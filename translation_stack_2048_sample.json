It was if his brain was pierced by a needle as he could not think at all. He did not know what had happened and did not know where he was, but he felt very uncomfortable.\nBut he figured that he was not lying in the small bed he was used to sleeping in.\nWhat was going on?\nThe four corners made him feel uneasy as the space was smaller than the room he rented. A streak of yellow light shone on his eyelids. There was a faint sound of water dripping behind his back, making him feel uneasy... Low-pitched voices could also be heard.\n\"Looks like he died. Annie, your methods were too brutal!\"\nThis was a female voice that had a blaming tone.\n\"It wasn’t on purpose. I didn’t know that his body was so weak? And, and, I didn’t do much at all.\"\nThe one called Annie sounded panicky as she spoke.\n\"That’s enough, we should think about what to tell Michelle.\"\n\"Michelle…...No! What should we do? Michelle will definitely kill us!\"\n\"Don’t drag me into this, it’s all your fault, you’re the one who killed him, and this has nothing to do with me...\"\nThe conversation continued on, the noise and the headache made Kubei’s head spin. But after a short while, he gradually got used to the pain, and regained his consciousness and ability to judge.\nHe opened his eyes with a struggle.\nThis was a small house, like those basements in a thriller film. It was pitch black, and the only source of light came from a torch on the wall. The moss had overtaken the corners of the wall and the ceiling, exuding considerable humidity and making it uncomfortable.\nKubei attempted to move around.\nHe immediately realized that he was tied to a chair, with his hands cuffed in thick hemp rope that was hurting his wrists.\nHe also realized that he felt extremely weak.\nIt was a weakness he had never felt before.\n\"What should we do…...Michelle…...Oh God, She, She’s here!\"\nThe slow clanking of heels interrupted their conversation and Kubei’s weak struggle.\nUnder the dim light, a blurry figure appeared.\nAs the figure was dressed in a huge robe with a hood concealing her face, there was no way to see the face clearly. The viridian robe wrapped her tightly, not leaving a single patch of skin exposed. No one could tell if perhaps there was a mannequin inside instead of a human.\nKubei knew it was a woman, solely because of the sound of heels and her name \"Michelle\".\nEven though he was still in a state of confusion, his instincts told him that now would be a good time to feign death.\nAnd so, he relaxed his body and lied in the chair motionless hoping no one would notice him.\nHe closed his eyes tightly and contracted his ears, closely paying attention as the situation unfolded.\n\"Michelle, you’re here...\"\nAnnie sounded like she was stuttering.\n\"Wake him up.\" A low and commanding voice came from within the robes.\n\"Michelle, I...\"\nAnnie was hesitant to speak, as she was finding difficulty to piece a sentence, she was interrupted."

He felt extremely uncomfortable. But in a situation like this, there was nothing that could be done. He just looked down and pretended he did not see anything at all.\nMichelle did not speak either, and this went on for awhile.\nThe short period of time felt really long.\nFinally, Michelle started speaking.\n\"What’s the secret to opening the treasury?\"\nKubei lifted his head, \"I don’t know.\"\n\"Sir Lithur.\" Michelle did not feel surprised at all from what she heard, \"Resistance is futile. You can return to your kingdom and be a noble genius, or you can rot in the belly of mice. The choice is yours, and I hope you make the right one.\"\n\"I’m not Sir Lithur. You’ve got the wrong person.\"\n\"Sir Lithur, my patience is limited.\" Michelle spoke politely, but her words were intimidating. \"Otherwise, you weren’t satisfied with the treatment just now, should I bring Annie over again?\"\n\".....\"\nKubei felt like crying but could not. \"Lady, I really don’t know anything!\"\nAfter regaining consciousness for so long, he could understand what was going on.\nBefore this, it was midnight, he was on a table, preparing a script for his boss’ speech for the following day.\nThat time he had already worked overtime for nearly half a month, he was tired mentally and physically. Due to the exhaustion, he fell asleep in front of the computer. In his dream, Kubei saw a man in his forties with a pair of briefs on his head, pointing at his nose, shouting, \"Balala energy, transform!\"\nThen there was a buzzing noise in his head.\nAfter that, all he could remember was waking up here."

He was just an ordinary person, living a normal live, but as one with wild dreams - he had read countless novels online. When he noticed that everything did not seem right, he quickly used his knowledge from the novels to draw a conclusion:\nHe had teleported.\nBecause of some unknown reason, he had been teleported into someone called Sir Lithur’s body, switching bodies with Sir Lithur. How coincidental that this Sir Lithur was not quite lucky for he was kidnapped by a bunch of mentally unstable women, even to the point where he was tortured in a formidable way.\nNow, it was his turn to be tortured.\nKubei drew his breath, as if he was mourning for the time he lost half of his month’s salary because of a skiing accident that tore his anus, making him unable to go to work.\nHe must be the unluckiest teleporter, ever.\n\"To the Lithur family, that treasury is only like a grain of rice in a huge stockpile of wheat.

Because the real Sir Lithur had been beaten to death!\nThe truth was right before his eyes.

Kubei followed Michelle, all the while acting as if he was about to die, which made Annie worry, but he was actually conscious of what he was doing and secretly plotting on how to escape.\nSuddenly, he raised his head and looked at Michelle, then he came up with an idea.\n\"This will do for now, there’s no other way.\"\nAnnie was hurrying him to continue moving, and he seemed obedient as he stumbled his way through. Out of the blue, he stopped moving, and pretended to have passed out and fell to the ground.\nHe closed his eyes and did not move at all.\nMichelle stopped walking and turned around. Annie went closer to inspect Kubei for a while, and shook her head:\n\"He fainted.\"\nMichelle did not say anything at all, but lowered her head in deep thought. There was no way to tell what she was thinking.\n\"These nobles are all useless.\"\nAnnie was unsatisfied, so she gave Kubei a kick.\nKubei managed to resist the pain and tried not to flinch.\nAt the same time, he wrote the words ----\"Treasury\" with the back of his hand that was behind his back on the ground.\nThis was what Kubei thought of: He pretended to faint to leave a mark, so the troops would know what Michelle’s objective was. With this, they can probably wait in ambush at the treasury.\nDue to his subtle movements, Annie and Michelle did not notice that he had left a mark on the ground.\n\"You really think this would be of help? Even if the troops noticed this marking and managed to catch up, Michelle would still have the time to kill you.\"\nThe System said this in his mind.\n\"It’s better than doing nothing at all,\" Kubei thought to himself.\nIn fact, if the troops managed to ambush them and kill Michelle in time, his chances of surviving were huge. The System’s attempt to discourage him was useless, seeing that Michelle was taking this rather seriously, the Lithur family probably were capable people. He had high hopes for his plan."

The sudden force made him unable to continue pretending.\nFollowing the shivering of his body, he \"woke\" up.\n\"How troublesome, wasting my magical force.\" Annie said, her voice now returned to normal.\nKubei was left in a state of shock.\nWhat was that? A curse? Magic?\nEven though from the previous conversations, Kubei had already learnt of the setting of this world, and understood that Michelle and Annie were both mages, but he had yet to witness a mage’s magical force himself.\nThe moment the spell was casted, it felt like his world went upside down.\nTime seemed to have stopped. The surrounding muddy ground and trees appeared to fade away. The fear and excitement in his soul interweaved, everything around and within him seemed to be…...to be...\nKubei could not describe the sensation.\n\"To be more natural.\" The system suddenly said.\nRight, to be more natural!\nKubei seemed to be abuzz. The moment the spell appeared, he felt that he just had a conversation with his true self.\nThe kind of feeling that felt like it was his first time, but it was even more memorable than his first time. It was like he was in a state of trance, but it was like pain from the endless abyss as well, making him unable to shake the feeling.\nHis body could not stop shivering.\n\"This…...is magic?\"\nKubei could not resist from speaking out.\nHe wanted more.\nIn that moment, he was remembering the lingering sounds from the spell.\n\"Yes, magic.\"\nWhat was more surprising was that Annie answered him.\nAs if she was deeply hurt, she raised her eyes and spoke with a voice filled with hatred:\n\"What’s so unusual? You and your kind don’t even understand magic and would rather bury it in a coffin deep in the soil. How could you ever comprehend it?\nKubei regained his consciousness, then looked at Annie with curiosity.\nIt was as if something got Annie emotional as her speech filled hatred came out one after another:\n\"You are all weak, you are all scared of what’s different from you. Your kind will only rest when everyone becomes as useless as the rest of you. You’re all shameless, and wear evil as a hat, making it seem as if you were geniuses. Being normal is just an excuse for you to commit sins.\"\nAnnie became agitated even further.\n\"Annie, that’s enough!\"\nMichelle interrupted her: \"What’s the use of you saying all these to him?\"\nAnnie stopped for a while, and stopped her harsh words.

It has been over half an hour since Annie first used that incantation until now. The sheer number of times the incantation has been repeated over that time added strength to its effectiveness.\nIt was the incantation that broke the darkness, seeped in, approached him as he lost his way, and finally called him up.\nAt this point, Kubei lifted his head and faced that ball of light.\nHe opened his mouth and uttered the incantation.\nMutant! Like a stone thrown onto a calm surface, the light began violently vibrating. Under Kubei’s supervision, the light compressed and condensed, grew in intensity, and condensed into a flowing solid!\nAfter some rumbling, the light shrank into a light ball the size of a fist.\nFinally, the light changed, and it became a light blue, triangular-shaped word. It looked like a triangle music instrument, with the thin blue lights folded into an equilateral triangle.\nIt was a perfect geometrical drawing, but on one of the edges, there was a narrow slit, which means the image has a gap.\nAs the triangle appeared, a ripple swept over the silent space, and it swarmed over Kubei, making his very soul quiver a little. After that, he felt some sort of humidity spread.\nHe could not tell why, but he knew that the whole space was different now.\nNot just the whole space, but Kubei could clearly feel like he was like a new man. It was like the locks on his body were opened, and he stepped into a whole new world, every cell on his body felt free and easy.\nIn this moment, the sparkling light blue triangular alphabet emitted something.\n\"Unbelievable.\"\nAt this moment, a robotic voice came from nowhere.\nKubei was shocked, \"You’re still here?\"\nThe System sounded as if it was unhappy,\n\"Of course I’m here. How did you think you woke up? If it weren’t for me repeating the incantation, you would’ve lost yourself in your consciousness and became a walking corpse.\nKubei was surprised, \"Ah, thank you very much then.\"\nHe didn’t mind that the System was unhappy, but instead he focused on the triangular alphabet.\nA triangle is the most basic shape in geometry, and this alphabet wasn’t that complicated, the only special part was that it wasn’t joined at one edge. It looked like a simple shape, but Kubei felt that it contained unbelievable power.\nIf he wasn’t wrong, this alphabet came from Annie’s incantation. That magic could summon a waterball, so this alphabet must be related to water.\nWater...\nKubei was slightly confused. After all that happened, now he has this glowing alphabet, but he wasn’t sure what was going on now.\nWhere was it? How did I come here? What purpose did this alphabet serve? He had so many questions that needed answers.\n\"Where is this?\"\nHe asked this question first."

The troops would probably be diverted by Annie, and the hope that they will come to the rescue is no longer possible. You’re absolutely done for this time.\" It was the truth.\nKubei sighed. What Michelle did was cruel. Not only did she send Annie to become cannon fodder, but she managed to seal off all of his escape routes. Whether it was to escape or be rescued, both outcomes were out of Kubei’s reach.\n\"Pity that I, such a magnificent piece of artificial intelligence who has so much potential, has to die here with you in this god forsaken place.\"\nThe System started to ramble on how unlucky it was, giving Kubei goosebumps.\n\"That’s enough, there’s no point in saying all these. \"Kubei interrupted it, \"Who says that you and I are about to die here?\"\nThe System stopped its rambling. Even though Kubei couldn’t see it, he could feel it looking down on him: \"Poor child, you’re about to die, having some hope is probably for the better.\"\nKubei didn’t take what it said to heart.\n\"Even a saint would make a mistake eventually. Michelle sealed off all of my escape routes, but, unknowingly, she may have opened a window for me.\"\nThe System was the same as usual: \"Really? Where’s the window, why can’t I see it?\nKubei didn’t explain, but laughed in his heart. His attention came back to reality, and he looked at Michelle who was unaware of what was going on. He said in his mind to the System:\n\"Her incantation just now, you’ve recorded it, right?\"\n\"...\"\nThe System was left speechless."

Everything was constant within it, with the blue triangular symbol shining in the darkness beyond. The voice of the System repeating the spell echoed in the space as well, just like the waterball spell, reverberating repetitively in the space.\nNothing happened.\nKubei felt as if he threw a pebble into a lake, wishing for ripples.

The act of throwing a pebble and breaking the frozen surface is like unlocking the dimension of your consciousness. However, unlocking your consciousness can only be used once, it is impossible to use the same method to learn a second spell.\"\n\"How could I learn it then?\"\n\"When it comes to this….\" The System halted for a few seconds, and said unabashedly, \"To whom should I forward your question to?\"\n\"…...\"\nHe should not have had expectations towards this fellow.\nKubei shook his head.\nAlthough the System blabbered like an old shaman, Kubei must admit that its inference towards the unlocking of the consciousness was quite reasonable. It would be unrealistic of him to learn the spell using the same method.\nIf he could not use this method, what could he do then?\nThe cons of self-teaching were eminent now. He became a mage without any theoretical basics.

Also…. the question from before, why did Michelle not erase the signals he left behind?\nHe had too many questions.\nBefore he managed to ask, Michelle spoke, \"Sir Lithur, please forgive the disrespect I’ve shown. I was only acting for our safety. Please relax, and I could answer your questions now.\"\nMichelle wiped the dagger with her sleeve and kept it safely. Then, she gazed at the direction the knight left and continued, \"About your signals, it was unfortunate to say that I have no need to clean them up.\"\nKubei was surprised and baffled, \"What do you mean?\"\nMichelle was momentarily silent, and as if she remembered something, she sarcastically said, \"You really thought there would be troops wanting to save you? Shame, you and Annie were cheated. There were no troops from the Lithur family. The only ones that were after us were the troop that just left.\" No troops?\nKubei was stunned.\nHow could it be? Did the family give up on him? It was Michelle who said again and again that there were troops from the Lithur family. Even Annie believed in her without doubt! Was everything a lie? Fuck this shit!\nThis woman planned to cheat everyone from the start. She did not even spare her accomplices! Kubei, a teleportation newbie, would of course be cheated. He wasted a whole night pondering on escape plans on these ‘troops’ that never existed! Uttering ‘fuck’ would not be sufficient to express his feelings.\nWithout the troops, he would be left with no choice but death!\n\"Wait, who are they?\"\nKubei asked, as he forced himself to remain level-headed despite being in shock and fear for his life. He thought and pointed towards the direction where the knights left. The knights had left quite an impression on him.\nHis instincts told him that they would be his last hope.\nHowever, Michelle’s tone of answer was strange, \"They…. They are the ‘Cleaners’ from the church.\"\nKubei asked again, \"Cleaners? What do they clean?\"\nMichelle heard him and was silent. She then laughed shortly without reason, her voice scratchy like rusted blades rubbing against each other. She stared at the direction where the knights came, and spoke with disdain and self-deprecation. This was her answer, \"Today, they are here to cleanse Annie.\"\nAnnie used to think about how she would die on a regular basis.\nShe jumped awake from her dream, damp from cold sweat. She tossed and turned in bed, but could not sleep anymore."

Chopped to pieces by Michelle, burnt to death by the church with Michelle, strangled Michelle to death with a rope…. There was even once where she and Michelle were at a dirty little motel, getting frisky with each other. But once she was awake, she never had any similar thoughts.\nUntil she decided to betray Michelle.\nThe thought to betray Michelle emerged once Michelle stopped trusting her. However, that was not the initial conflict. Before Sally appeared, Michelle was Annie’s belief, her mental support – Michelle was her God.\nMichelle could kill anyone, Michelle could get anything she wanted.\nIt was like the first time she met Michelle. It was in a motel late at night, and Michelle arrived like a messenger from God. She descended from the sky, and beheaded Annie’s client with a swing of her sword.\nThe scene from that moment was fresh as if it happened only yesterday: The client’s headless body was still lying on top of her, and it shuddered and twitched like a cock plucked clean of its feathers. The head had a slightly amusing expression as it rolled on the floor. Blood was everywhere, painting the yellowish mattress and blankets. Even the stubborn, moldy smell on the blanket was washed away.\nGod knows how much she hated that moldy stench.\nEvery time she took in a client, she could only focus on the ceiling of the motel to distract herself from the awful smell. No matter how terrible the client was, she could always zone herself out to ignore the quavering flesh and oily noses. The only thing she could never put up with was the distasteful smell of the mold.\nThat smell was alike the childhood bedsheet that she had. It was humid and sticky, and it reminded her constantly how lowly she became.\nIn order to avoid the smell, she would open her mouth to breathe. Sometimes, some clients would take that as a compliment and perform more vigorously, but she never paid much attention.\nLooking back, the only thing she remembered clearly throughout the five years of her work was the ceiling that she spaced out on, and the gruesome odor of the blanket.\nThus, when Michelle killed the client, Annie was not afraid. Instead, she felt a slight sense of ease and elation as the scent of blood flushed away the moldy stench.\nAfter that, Michelle kept her sword and looked at an expressionless Annie.\n\"Follow me, and you will be a mage,\" she said.\nAt that time, Annie had no idea what was a mage. But she nodded, and she etched that sentence into her heart. Until now, she could still utter the sentence without missing any words. The moment was as if it was paused into an oil painting, the details on Michelle’s clothes, the angle of the opened door, the position where the head rolled away, the shape of the stains on the wall…. It was like it happened just moments before, and the scene was as fresh as fishes that just got caught from the sea.\nThat was how unbelievable Michelle’s existence was.\nMaybe that was why Annie was enraged when she found out Michelle no longer believed in her."

Annie never knew where her father was, and her mother refused to say anything about her father after her mother’s return.\nAfter that, it seemed like her mother gave up, and she stopped going out to find her father. Instead, she got addicted to beer. Annie was afraid of her drunk mother. Sometimes she would jump awake at night, and realize that her mother was staring at her, but instead of a loving gaze of a mother towards her child, it was a hateful gaze towards an enemy.\nEven when she was drunk, her mother would caress her brother with the softest touch, sing lullabies to him, tuck him under the blanket, or steal milk from the neighboring village for him.

There were those that were used to bless and baptize the knights, and they were warm and holy; there were those that were used to torture the heathens, and they burnt but would not kill; there were those that were used to annihilate enemies, and they were so powerful that they could cleanse a person in a blink of an eye, without leaving a trace.\nThe holy light that Annie got was the third type.\nThe terrifying temperature evaporated her cloak and her skin with a blink of an eye, and the strong burn prohibited her from releasing even a basic protection magic. She could not see anything, holy light was everywhere, and it was so bright it was impossible to look at.\nShe was cleansed by the Cleaners before she could betray Michelle.\nTiny specks of dust floated around the midnight forest like butterflies, and like butterflies, they were stepped on by the Cleaners’ hooves and turned into mud.\nAnnie died. Before she died, she suddenly thought….\nNo, she had no time to think. She had no time to review this method of dying, it was unknown if she thought evaporation by holy light to be tragic enough for her. She also had no time to regret betraying Michelle, or anything else. Her life did not flash before her eyes, there was no childhood happiness nor sadness.\nOn the other side of the night sky, Kubei’s situation was not any better than Annie’s.\n\"You were willing to harm your partners just to lie to me?\"\nIt wasn’t that Kubei’s sense of justice flared up all in a sudden and that felt sorry for Annie. It was just the fact that aside from criticising Michelle from a moral high ground, he really had no idea what he could say.\nHowever, he must continue talking. To shut up now will have no difference from sitting around and waiting for death to arrive. After all, he was still in a ‘negotiation’ with Michelle, although the direction of the negotiation was opposite of what was originally planned by Kubei.\nStill, this was his last shot for survival.\n\"Why is that a problem?\" Michelle’s attitude also began to become aggressive. \"Sir Lithur, I seemed to have treated you too well for our continued partnership. However, you seemed to have taken it as an invitation to converse with me at your whim.\"\nWell my ass.\nKubei felt immense pressure. It was obvious that Michelle was ready to stop the goody-two-shoes act and end the negotiations soon. This was not good news for Kubei.\nWhether it was for his survival or just to delay his death, Michelle must continue talking.\nThus, he tried to be stern: \"Lady Michelle, you depend wholly on me to open the treasury. I can also change my mind at any minute. Do not forget, I wield the power to stop you from getting whatever you want forever.\"\nHowever, Michelle’s answer came faster than he expected, \"Oh, do not rush, my good sir. I will treat you well with my leather whip, and I believe in no time you will know what decision you will make by the door.\"\n\"….\"\nKubei must admit that these softly-spoken threats sounded much scarier than the ones that were made in a frightening manner."

Just give up!\"\nThus, no matter what Kubei does, Michelle decided on one truth: This is Grant Lithur, even if he shat through his mouth or peed through his nose, he is still Grant fucking Lithur!\n\"…. That’s about it, she would assume I’m lying to her regardless of what I said,\" Kubei explained his reasoning to the System and concluded.\nThe System remained silent for a few moments.\n\"…. That was a shit deduction.\"\n\"Thanks for the compliment,\" Kubei felt at peace with himself.\nAlthough it was widely exaggerated, he still believed that he nailed Michelle’s thoughts almost perfectly. He could not find any other logical explanation to interpret Michelle’s eerie behavior.\nAs he understood what was happening, he had the urge to tell Michelle, \"Thinking too much into things is a disease, you need to get that cured.\"\nEvery dog has its day, and Kubei really had the dumb luck that saved his life. All thanks\nto the \"I forgot to bring my homework\" expression that he mastered.\nHowever, once he got into the details, the rationale behind this was complicated too. Michelle sacrificed so much for the treasury, and was willing to give up on her companions and be on her own. The fact that \"Kubei is a fake\" will be a huge blow to her now, as it meant that all her efforts were a waste.\nThus, she was more willing to believe that Kubei was Grant Lithur, as that gave her the hope to get the treasure.\nOne will only believe what she intends to believe.\nOnce he thought about it this way, Michelle did not look as intimidating anymore. The church was closely following them and she actually faced the same pressure as him in walking at the brink of death. She was just more used to it, and hence behaved calmer than he did.\nKubei was not Grant Lithur anyway, and her effort was fated to be for naught. Tragic.\nOf course, Kubei did not have the capability to feel sorry for Michelle if he was tortured to death by an enraged Michelle. No matter how pitiable Michelle was, she still held his life in her hands.\nUnless….\nKubei grabbed onto the breeze."

You killed your companions for it. There are only few things in the world that could let mages go mad for, hence my curiosity.\" Kubei was disgusted by his own mischievous tone. He had no choice but to go as low as possible just to protect his own life.\nIf he did not do this, he could not confirm his other ‘deduction’.\n\"There is nothing to be curious about,\" Michelle looked as if she could not hold herself\n\"Why could it be nothing? There is so much to be asked, you see,\" Kubei added fuel to the flame.\n\"Shut up!\" Michelle could not take it anymore.\nAh, finally.\nKubei felt that he successfully trailed the breeze to chip open the sealed cave. He felt the rays of hope on his face.\n\"You want me to shut up?\" The mischievous demeanor was no more, and Kubei sounded serious.\n\"Yes, you blabber too much,\" Michelle has yet to realise what happened.\n\"If so, why did you not shut me up yourself? Just use the magic you deployed just now, and let me be quiet. ‘I hope you do not make trouble for me,’ was that not what you said before?\" Kubei slowed down in his speech. What accompanied his next words was also his heartbeat, \"Or, you do not dare to use your magic anymore?\"\nMichelle froze.\nAlthough Kubei could not see her expression, he knew that she lost her composure. He felt strange once Michelle started treating him atrociously. He did not know what was weird, but when he had the epiphany, he understood. He was chatty because he wanted to test out his theory: Since Michelle wanted him to shut up, why did she not use the Binding Spell again to stun him?\nWhen he was under the Binding Spell, he could not speak. The spell came with a gagging\neffect. Through trial and error, the answer was out. She could not use the spell. Combine that with the existence of the Cleaners, it was obvious that Michelle dare not use the spell to avoid alerting the church of her presence.\nThus, it can be concluded that the Cleaners could sense magic within a certain radius.\nWhen she previously used the Binding Spell, Annie just left, and had yet to be killed by the Cleaners. Thus, when the Cleaners sensed magic and saw a person dressed like a witch who wanted to ‘surrender to the Lithur family’s troops’, they assumed she was Michelle, the mage who used the Binding Spell.\nHence, they cleansed Annie without any hesitation. Then, they would also assume that the mage was neutralized, and would leave the area after some patrolling. Michelle would then escape successfully under the eyes of the Cleaners, and the evil deeds she did before will all fall on the deceased Annie."

Honestly, if I did not use a special way to mask our tracks, the dogs from the church could still smell our presence in the absence of magic.

He shut his eyes, took a deep breath. Together with a unique wave, an incantation flowed out of his mouth.\nIt was the Waterball Spell.\nWithin Kubei’s space of consciousness, the light blue triangular symbol pulsed slightly.

The only way she could escape was to leave Kubei behind. Then, Kubei would behave like an innocent hostage, and the Cleaners would escort him back to the Lithur family.\nOf course, it was possible for Michelle to kill Kubei as she was infuriated, but he felt the possibility was slim. If she had to take on the blame of killing a noble, the pressure on her would increase disproportionately.

It swayed from left to right, and moved more like a zombie than a human.\nAlso, that whine would not feel out of place if you inserted it into Plants vs Zombies.\n\"Fuck, is that a ghost?\" Kubei felt quite terrified.\nHe felt that something was wrong with the setting of this world. He previously saw mages and the church, so what was a zombie doing here? Unless, the name of this novel was somewhere along the lines of ?\nHe felt as if he was struck by thunder.\nThe silhouette that resembled a human approached him gradually, and Kubei still could not see anything in the dark. He could not check if the face was as horrendous as the ones with special effects that were drawn onto the actors. However, once he got out from shock and recalled the zombie movies he watched, he realised that this thing before him was not very threatening after all.\nLook at the speed it had. It was moving like a sloth; how dangerous could it be?\nHence, Kubei calmed himself down and raised the heavy item he had in his hand. He waited quietly for it to come over. Around 30 seconds later, when he judged that the distance was appropriate, he threw the can directly at the thing’s head.\nClang!\nA loud sound was heard, and Kubei felt a headache vicariously from the thing.\nIt halted it movements. Kubei nervously glanced at the silhouette, afraid that the impact did not affect it. The can was not very heavy at all. Based on this body that he teleported into, there was only a few heavy things that he could carry.\nIf it was not afraid of the can, what should he do?\nNot the Waterball Spell, right? He never heard of zombies that are terrified of water.\nJust when Kubei was anxiously staring at the thing, a horrifying scream started from the silhouette.\n\"Ahhhhhhh!\"\nThat was such a devastating cry, it resembled an old cat with its tail stepped by a 200-pound person. It echoed throughout the mansion, and the lights in every single room lit up simultaneously, the doors opened one by one, footsteps were heard from every direction.\nThe once silent night suddenly became rowdy.\n\"Why? What happened?\"\n\"Who was making so much noise in the middle of the night?\"\n\"That voice, it was quite familiar.\"\n\"….\"\nThe darkness was chased away, and Kubei was finally able to clearly see his surroundings.\nThe strange silhouette a few steps away from him was a man with golden hair. He wore silk pyjamas, his face was one of utter shock, an unknown brown liquid dripping from his beautiful curled hair. His pearly white pyjamas was also stained with lines of the liquid.\n\"Ah, oh….\"\nKubei’s expression turned bad once he saw what happened.\nSo, the setting of this world was not weird. That was a human, not a zombie."

He did not think that absorbing Benjamin Lithur’s memories would have taken him from midnight until dawn, leaving him with no time to rest.\nBut it was not the system’s fault, the System did simplify the memory to a point where he could fully understand the situation in half an hour. But the problem was that it was too simplified. Kubei searched it a few times but still found no clue about who could have hired the assassin.\nHe had to narrow down his search, so he began asking the System all the small details within the memories.\nThis method of searching was like trying to find a needle in a haystack, and the system’s tendency to go haywire didn’t help. The process ended up going all the way to dawn when the butler came to call him to breakfast, but he still did not have any results. In other words: he still did not know who wanted him dead.\nKubei felt defeated, it was like he wasted his whole night for nothing.\nNothing could be done, time was up, he could no longer continue looking through the details of the memories. The butler was waiting for him, and he had to go meet the Lithur family members ----It was more important than what he was doing right now.\nWould he be able to manage to deceive his \"own\" relatives?\nBut from this point of view, he was not actually wasting his time. He remembered the simplified memories, and even revised many of the details, which would a big help in trying to pretend to be \"him\".\nRelying on these memories, dealing with the butler was no problem.\n\"Alright, I’ll be right over.\""

Otherwise, that hope would haunt his mind, making it hard for him to eat and sleep.\nHe did not fear that he would be suspected by the Church. His memories had already been acquired by the \"Cleaner\", so the people of the Church probably did not suspect him one bit. Could they even think of the possibility of a person having two separate memories from interdimensional travel?\n\"Sir Lithur.\"\nSuddenly, a low voice interrupted his thoughts.\nBenjamin recovered from his deep thoughts and turned around. From the veil of the confession room, he could make up from the blur that a middle aged man with an aquiline nose sat at the other side.\n\"Lord Bishop.\" He replied with respect.\nHe wanted to use the water element sensing method he used on the assassin previously to sense the bishop. But after thinking that this was a church, some of them probably knew some divine arts, so for safety reasons, he did not.\n\"I’m not a bishop, I’m only a priest who is willing to hear the confessions of a citizen, granting the forgiveness of God to every guilty youth.\" The other party had an inhumanly calm voice, like it was devoid of humanity,\"Are you saying you have information on the servant of the Devil, and wish to alert God?\"\nThese religious people mentioned God in almost everything they spoke about. Benjamin could not help but feel revolted.\nHe did not express these feelings, but still maintained his respect: \"Yes.\"\nThe bishop was silent for a while, then asked: \"So you are saying, the servant of the Devil that cursed you has started to communicate with you?\nHearing this, Benjamin frowned.\nPlanted a curse?\nThe bishop’s words created turmoil in his heart, and diverted his focus from Annie’s treasure. Even though the statement was rhetorical, he still understood what he meant: He has been cursed? What happened? What did I miss?\nBenjamin suddenly had a bad feeling.\n\"Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you.\" The System came out of nowhere and explained: \"Before Michelle escaped, she chanted some sort of complicated incantation at you, then a dark red light flew into your chest. I didn’t know what that was at the time, but right now, I think it’s probably the curse he mentioned.\"\n\"...\"\nHe felt cheated by the system once more, and was speechless."

Lord Bishop, I do not wish to die by her hands, you have to save me, please!\nThe bishop did not react to the \"panicking\" Benjamin. After some thought, he asked: \"Where is the letter? Did you bring it?\"\nBenjamin was prepared for this: \"No. The letter burnt away on its own after I was done reading it, not a trace of it was left, it almost burnt my fingertips, and it was too scary.\"\nThe bishop remained sullen, as if he thought this was a difficult problem too.\nBenjamin observed the bishop awhile. He felt like he has the bishop fooled, so he threw in the final act:\n\"Lord Bishop, God is omnipotent. Could I please ask God to release this evil curse from me?\"\nEven though a small curse was enough to make him worry, but he knew, the Church had ways to release this curse.

Because of this he did not panic at all, but he was a bit nervous, just a little.\nBiological parents are probably much closer than a grandmother, but speaking of relational gaps, it was probably the biggest between parents and their children. A child would never let their parents know their true self, and parents would never reveal their many sides to their children as well.\nEspecially as he was the least important child in the family; and especially as it was during the most rebellious teenage years.\nBased on the parts of life that the System played for him, he was like a total stranger to his father, every time they had a conversation, the atmosphere would be dull and awkward. The Benjamin previously would remained tight-lipped around his parents. This kind of act was easy to put up even if he did not have a ‘cheat code’ to help him.\nAfter all, he has impenetrable confidence in himself now.\n\"Very well, I’ll go right now.\"\nAfter finishing, he looked at Jeremy carefully, then suddenly said: \"Oh yeah, I need you to do me a favor.\"\n\"Master, what is it?\"\nBenjamin thought for a while then said: \"At the east of the city there is a carpenter right, I need you to go there and buy me a cross from there, be careful. Right, no sitting on a carriage, I don’t have that much pocket money for you to use.\"\nJeremy’s face seemed to droop down: \"Ah…...Master, it’s really far from here, if I were to walk there I would only return by midnight.\"\nBenjamin gave a kind smile and said: \" No matter, walk slowly, I’m not in a hurry of wanting it.\"\nIf it was not far I would not have sent you in the first place.\nThese was one of Benjamin’s strategies: Have Jeremy run errands for him and do some unrelated things or things to show his devotion. If he were to do this every day, up to twenty or more times, if the Church still paid any attention to Jeremy, then they are really capable men.\nOnce he has diverted the Church’s attention fully, he can have Jeremy dig up Annie’s treasure.\nNo matter how picky the system was, it had to admit that this was not a bad plan at all.\nAnd thus, Jeremy began his first step on his long journey with a bitter face. Benjamin did not think of anything further, but hastened his footsteps towards home.\nHis father wanted to see him, he could not walk leisurely all the way back.\nThe Lithur family house was around the uptown area, not far from Saint Peter’s cathedral. After a while, Benjamin arrived. The servant at the entrance did not say much and only bowed at him, and opened the door to let him in.\n\"Your father and the rest are in the living room.\"\nThe servant at the entrance reminded him.\nHe nodded at the servant, then walked into the living room.\nThe moment he his right foot entered the living room, he felt that something was off.\nThis atmosphere, it was rather scary.\nAnd…...why…...were there so many people in the living room?"

The atmosphere was really tense.\nEspecially during the moment he entered, all their gazes came onto him, every one of them were like torchlights in the hands of a policeman, it felt like the following second they would all say \"Hands in the air\", then bullets would come flying.\nIt was obvious, all of them were here for him.\n\"What’s going on?\"\nBenjamin was rather afraid, and asked the System.\n\"Why are you panicking, I’ve seen this kind of scenario far too many times.\" The System was rather calm. After saying this, it kept silent for a while, then slowly said something that poisoned Benjamin till he was half dead.\nIt said: \"All of them are here to break off an engagement.\"\n\"...\" Benjamin was frustrated. Why did he keep so many web novels in his computer, poisoning the mind of a smart and happy artificial intelligence, making it turn into so serious.\nEven so, he could not resist, and said this to the system:\nThe middle-aged man who sat in the main seat scowled quietly at Benjamin. However, his eyes did not have even a hint of happiness. Instead, they were eyes of accusation, and Benjamin felt distressed by that look.\nWhat even happened here? Claude Lithur was Benjamin’s biological father. Benjamin had detailed memories of Claude. Claude was the head of the household, the Duke of the Kingdom. He had a very high status within the noble hierarchy in the Kingdom of Helius, and was typically a conservative noble.\nConservative nobles would pledge loyalty to the king, where they would in turn pledge loyalty towards the church alongside the king. The matters of social class were of absolute importance to them, and they put much emphasis on the segregation of the peasants from the nobles. This also meant that they were very prideful, and they followed what was called the ‘honor of the nobles’. In other words, this individual was very archaic and feudal.\nFrom a personal perspective, Benjamin’s father was also a strict man, and it was a rare occurrence to catch him smiling. This illustrated his sternness as a father, as he had high expectations of his eldest son Benjamin, but Benjamin embarrassed him. Evidently, Benjamin was not going to get a good look from him."

Last night, he was the person who assaulted me using that…. thing!\"\nBenjamin became increasingly confused after he heard this.\n\"Who is this?\"\nJust to be cautious, Benjamin did not give any reaction in real life. Instead, he consulted the System by telepathy.\n\"Hmm, he probably would be Dick Fulner. Remember? He was the person who sleepwalked last night, and the one who you splashed him in the face with bodily excretions,\" the System answered.\nUpon hearing the System, Benjamin paused and studied the person, and could finally feel some familiarity from his face.\nThe nose that pointed towards the sky and looked eerily similar with the nose of a pig was the exact replica of the poor sod last night.

Thus, he swallowed his words with difficulty.\nHe finally understood the situation before him. The flow of the process was that this Mister Dick was a guest at his house last night, but he started sleepwalking and met Benjamin, who just woke up. Benjamin then used the chamber pot to hit him square in the face. Mister Duke could not hold his anger, which was why he got his father over to the Lithur manor in order for him to salvage whatever dignity he could. This war was brewed just like that.\nHe realized the difficult grounds he was on.\nAfter much contemplation, Benjamin did not rush to explain when Dick pointed at him. Instead, he learned from the original Benjamin and behaved like a teenager being reprimanded after a mistake, with his head drooped low and his face stubborn.\nExplanations would only make matters worse.

There were no rivalry between families that was often depicted in the novels, nor the custom to avoid criticizing their family members when outsiders were present. Akin to the Western aristocrats, they interacted in harmony under the illumination of the church, without any conflicts. The western ideology on families is so feeble.\nWithout the support of the family, Benjamin’s circumstances were not only difficult - it was more like a struggle session, where everyone was against him.

It was better for him to apologize first before Claude could force him to do so. This would improve Claude’s impression on him, but could also avoid the Fuller family from taking advantage of the situation. He believed that if his attitude was portrayed perfectly, the Fulners could not find another reason to pick at him anymore.\nAs Benjamin expected, after hearing Benjamin’s ‘sincere’ apology, Claude’s expression was coloured with a hint of surprise. His fury was slightly soothed after that.\nAfter all, Benjamin’s behavior now was more mature than he ever was. Of course, no one suspected a thing nor imagined anything ridiculous like teleportation.

I will not accept your apology!\" Dick Fulner’s attitude was still harsh.\nEven the System popped up spookily and agreed, \"Exactly, what use would the police be if apologies were that effective?\"\n\"....\" Benjamin ignored the anarchic System, and gazed at Claude. Claude looked like he wanted to stay quiet and let the younger generation resolve the dispute. Benjamin could only ask, \"What then do you want me to do?\"\nDick glared and looked down at him contemptuously.

Thus, it can be concluded that his grandmother with her peculiar personality had a great status within the household.\nHowever, Benjamin had a premonition that the madame's actual intention was not to retire for the night. If she did, why would she express these insinuating remarks?\nWas she trying to stir up trouble?\nIf it is, she should do so as soon, and as big of a trouble as possible. This could provide him some time to come up with a plan for him to get through this mess.\n\"I'll let Anna attend to you as you rest.\"\nClaude told the madame as he rose and turned to make eye contact with the servants by the door.\n\"There will be no need for that. What, do you think I'm too old to do anything? I could walk by my own,\" the madame waved dismissively, and stood with her cane.\n\"But....\" Claude was hesitant.\n\"What 'but'? Mary hasn't said anything, so why are you so distressed? Am I right, Mary?\" Impatiently, the madame interrupted Claude and instead looked at Benjamin's mother, who was standing beside Claude.\nMary - Benjamin's mother, Claude's wife. Obviously, she would be shocked, as would never have expected the madame to pass the conversation to her. Her eyes widened, and her hands covered her gaping mouth.\nAfter some consideration, Mary answered, \"It depends entirely on you, mother, for I have no opinions on this matter.\"\nIn his heart, Benjamin was busy criticizing the situation. An in-law conflict, and one that failed to even build into a proper fight. This would not be of much help to him, and it would not be able to drag much time as well. Once the madame left the hall, Dick Fulner would again hold his chamber pot high, aimed towards him.\nThere was no time for him to stay put being an audience. There was nothing to watch anyway, as unlike the drama all over the television channels.\nHe should hurry up and think of what to do!\nIf Dick insisted to hit him with the chamber pot, could he be hard-headed and disagree anyways? Claude would not disown him from the Lithur family, would he?\nWhat if he was actually disowned?\nBenjamin's heart went cold. If he was disowned, he would have no choice but to seek refuge with the church. The church would not treat him badly as they would still need him for Michelle's capture. However, if he wanted to learn magic under the eyes of the church, it would literally feel like going into the Nightmare Level right after the Tutorial - the game was rigged and anti-human.\nHe would be more pathetic if he ended up on the streets. The church would never allow him to be homeless though, and they would probably put him under their control. To some degree, staying in the Lithur family would be the best choice he could make to guarantee his freedom of movement.\nJust as Benjamin was plotting his escape route, the madame who was preparing her departure did something very strange. As if she was suddenly weakened. her cane slipped, she swung and fell to her side."

However, her face was still one of naivete, as if what she said was just common everyday conversations. Benjamin’s jaw gaped wider.\nApparently, his grandmother had a much higher status in the Lithur family than he imagined. It was so high, he lost sight of it.\nAlso…. His conservative, ancient father. He was actually a mama’s boy?\n\"Your grandfather passed away early in his age, and she was the one who raised your father. The early Lithur family was solely led by her, and according to the rumors you knew previously, she has a special status within the kingdom, but you have no idea exactly what it is.\"\nThe System reappeared and explained, just like it was in an anime.\n\"You didn’t mention this before,\" Benjamin grumbled secretly.\n\"Ah, these are mere details. How could I include everything in the summarized version of your memory? Ugh, you’re so troublesome,\" the System offhandedly commented.\n\"....\"\nBenjamin felt empty, and he could not even muster the desire to complain.\nWhen he snapped back into reality, Accius was still choked by the madame’s words. Thus, she showed her ‘reasonable side’ and once again hit back at Accius while she had her chance by adding further comments to put the final hand."

I saw Sir Dick, and he didn’t look normal, so probably he was already sleepwalking. He held that thing in his hands, and before I could wake him up, he fell down by himself, and…. Everyone saw what happened after that.\" He thought to himself as he was talking, ‘Ah, my acting skills are improving steadily. Even I will be afraid of someone this shameless!’\nAfter Accius heard what Benjamin said, he immediately regained his ability to articulate and scolded Benjamin sternly, \"You’re lying!\"\nBenjamin promptly looked frail and powerless, as if he was going to burst into tears.\nThe madame also joined in to send help and hammer the last nails, \"How could you not believe this, Duke? Was there another side of the story to this incident? Ah, where is Dick? We should ask him what happened last night, he was the only one left who knew the whole truth!\"\nWhere was Dick, oh, where was Dick?\nDick was lying in the fragrant pile of feces.\nAccius glared at the unconscious Dick, his fat cheeks trembling, his eyes spouting fire.\n\"Ah, how could I only remember this now?\" The madame also glanced at Dick, and she suddenly looked enlightened, \"I remember hearing from someone that a sleepwalking person will not remember what they did during that time. Oh, what should we do! There’s no use in asking Dick now. Duke Accius, I’m sorry, but I think this unsolvable case will not have any resolution. I feel bad for this.\"\nUltra kill.\nBenjamin nearly applauded. If the madame was making up nonsense before, these last few sentences were the ones that hit the nail directly on the right spot. A sleepwalking person is unconscious, and Dick actually had no idea who was the one who hit him with the chamber pot. All he did was wake up and see Benjamin, and assumed that he did it.\nActually, no one saw the moment when Benjamin threw the chamber pot at Dick. In other words, the only one who could explain what happened last night was Benjamin, and even if somebody else suspected him, no one could prove him wrong.\nIf he said Dick spilled the chamber pot himself, then Dick spilled the chamber pot himself.\nPoor Dick…. What the madame concluded made Accius appear like he was dumped with a pail of cold water. He gradually realized this. He looked at the unconscious Dick, and the sympathetic madame. His desire to be defensive died down like deflating balloon. The Fulner family members shared a look, and they looked furious but also helpless.\nFinally, Accius admitted defeat.\n\"Madame, Sir Duke, we will meet at the ball next month.

He felt vulnerable.\nHe finally realized how scary of a punishment detention was.\nAfter he sprawled on the floor for some time, his sight shifted towards the potatoes scattered around him. Although they were raw and probably would not taste any good, but.... he could probably still eat it.\n\"Can potatoes be eaten raw?\" he asked the System.\nThe System answered, \"Never tried, you can go ahead though.\"\n\"...\"\nBenjamin would totally scream abuse at the System if he was not weak due to hunger.\nAh, who would care! He was too hungry to care about trivial things! People always talked about how those in famine would eat tree barks and leather, of course he could eat raw potatoes, right? The mashed potatoes in KFC were quite alike with raw potatoes, and he was still alive after eating them.\nHe would rather die from food poisoning than starvation.\nDying from starvation would be miserable and would make a good joke to laugh about at lunch. It would be so embarrassing!\nHowever, cause of death by consuming raw poisonous potato would be quite embarrassing too....\nAh, fuck it! What use would it be to worry! He wanted to be the first warrior who ate a raw potato!\nUnder the urge of hunger, Benjamin grabbed a potato close to his hand, opened his mouth and was prepared to take a bite.\nSuddenly, a clatter was heard in the cellar.\nBenjamin was startled, but he had already taken a bite off the potato and could no longer hold back. His teeth firmly chomped down on the potato, and immediately a soreness rose from his mouth, and he felt his jaw slackened, as if it nearly dislocated.\nShit, that was so fucking hard! He could not even bite into it!\nThe sore Benjamin quickly threw the potato away, and he turned to look at the source of the strange noise.\nThe door of the metal door now was slightly ajar, and a pair of sky blue eyes appeared. The pair of eyes were wide, and they stared straight at Benjamin. Benjamin was very surprised.\nIt was the gentle voice of a woman, that sounded rather familiar, but Benjamin could not recall who it belonged to.\n\"Who is this person?\"\nHe asked the System by telepathy.\n\"Your mom.\" The System deadpanned.\n\"....\""

        "output": "At the ‘friendly’ reminder of the System, Benjamin finally remembered whose voice was that. It was the voice of Mary, the one who spoke once in the living room - wife of Claude, daughter-in-law of the madame, mother of Benjamin. His mother sent the guarding maid away on some errands, and sneaked in to visit him.\nAccording to the summarized memories given by the System, Mary was a good wife and a loving mother. Her pleasant personality was well-known in the kingdom. Since young, Benjamin never saw her lose her temper at anyone, and she always had a good relationship with everyone - excluding the madame, of course.\nEven though the madame never liked Mary and always picked on her, she never actually retaliated. Instead, she quietly accepted the madame’s harsh treatment. Mary could be considered a role model for daughter-in-laws for the century, really.\nWhen she was with Benjamin, she did not treat him coldly or disappointingly despite the fact that he was a hopeless case. She treated Benjamin how she treated Grant, and both of them were well taken care of. This was almost unheard of, as it was normal for people to favor one child over another even though there was not much difference between them, what more in Benjamin’s family, where the children differed vastly in their achievements.\nBenjamin considered all this and stopped hesitating. Immediately, he pleaded pitifully.\n\"Mother, you’re finally here.\"\nAlthough he did not complain, but his woeful and feeble voice alone could convey how absolutely miserable he was feeling.\nHe hoped he could trigger his mother’s unending sympathy.\n\"Yes. I could only visit you after your father left the manor. Here, you must be starving now, I got the chambermaid to make some extra bread so I could bring them to you. Have some to lace your stomach so you could get through this,\" Mary did not disappoint Benjamin’s expectations as she passed him a small paper package through the opening of the door while she talked.\nBenjamin felt a sudden rush of excitement. He took the package and opened it with trembling fingers. There were two pieces of warm, soft bread, and they lied quietly in the package. The scent of wheat and milk wafted through the air.\nAh, this…. Food!\nBenjamin nearly broke into tears.\nThe best person in the world is a mother. Every child with a mother is treated like treasure.\nAlthough he had the urge to chow down on the bread immediately, he endured his starvation and gazed thankfully at the blue eyes by the door, \"Thank you, I nearly starved to death here.\"\nMary stood by the door, chuckled and said, \"Don’t worry, I will try and talk to your father tomorrow once his temper is gone. He would let you out by then. Be calm, as your father would never hold you here for long.\"\nBenjamin was relieved like he just ate an anti-stress pill upon hearing that. If he was locked here for too long, it would disrupt his plans of learning magic. He could only let Jeremy dig out Annie’s effects if he got out of here soon."

After watching Mary left, Benjamin started to eat the bread that he was holding.\nThe portion of bread was not small, but he was so hungry he could even take a bigger portion. In a blink of the eye, there was only an empty paper package and some bread crumbs on his palms. Benjamin rubbed his tummy in a gratifying manner, and burped in content.\nHe rolled the paper into a ball and hid it in the sea of potatoes in order to avoid detection.\nThen, he sprawled lazily on the floor among the potatoes, closed his eyes, and dived into the depth of his consciousness.\nHe never planned to waste his time sitting around in the cellar. Since he had nothing to do, he might as well investigate the space of his consciousness and the blue triangular symbol in it. It was not impossible for him to self-learn magic without guidance.\nIn fact, his way of learning magic so far has been by way of self-taught, wasn’t it?\nOf course, he also considered practicing the only spell he knew - the Waterball Spell. In the common novels, the way to train your special abilities was to use them repeatedly. However, his present location was too close to the chapel, and if Michelle was telling the truth, the Cleaners could detect magic from a certain radius. If the church was alerted, his death would be imminent.\nThus, even if he wanted to practice magic, he could only do it within the space of his consciousness.\nWhen he previously used the Waterball Spell there, Michelle was unable to detect that despite standing right next to him. Thus, the chapel that was situated a few streets away probably would not feel this.\nThe space of his consciousness…..It was really a mysterious existence.\nAlthough he had no idea how Michelle and the others learnt their magic, his instinct told him that they did not possess a space of their own consciousness. They did not have this magical space, and also never had such a literal magical emblem like the blue symbol. Their road to becoming a mage was most probably different from Benjamin’s.\nThis made him even more curious towards the space of his consciousness.

After the little experiment he did just now, he had a more systematic understanding of magic.\nThe ‘Water’ element was the basis of all his magic. To him, the element could be categorized into two groups: the water particles in the space of his consciousness, or the water particles that floated around in the real world. He could sense and communicate with the water particles in the real world, but they were difficult to command. When he recalled the only time he used the Waterball Spell in real life, the water particles he utilized were all from his space.\nThe water particles in the space of his consciousness gathered themselves around the magical emblem. Through the emblem, Benjamin could control the water particles for magic. Every time he used his magic, he would use up some of the water particles. So, in other words, the water particles he stored in his space would be his source of ‘magical powers’.\nThe more water particles he stored, the stronger the magical powers he could release.\nAside from learning new spells, this was the only way to become stronger that Benjamin could think of. If he could learn new spells, he would choose that without hesitation, but all he had now was himself. From where could he learn them from? He was not confident and did not think that he could invent new spells. Now, he could only wait for Annie’s hidden treasures.\nThus, after he simplified his thoughts, the only thing he could do right now was to increase the concentration of water particles stored in the space of his consciousness.\nThe problem now was, how could he do so?\nWell, of course he was going to get them from the real world.\nThis was probably what the common fantasy novels called as ‘the mage’s meditation’: to collect magical elements from the environment and store them, thus increasing their abilities in the process.\nAs a matter of fact, any special powers ranging from magic to Qi battles all had the same process: storage, accumulation, transformation. If everything goes as he expected, the world he was in was no different from that. As long as he would persistently accumulate his magical element, he could be stronger.\nAnd that, was the training method of a mage that he comprehended by himself.\n\"Ah, I’m such a genius!\"\nHe felt pompous as this was the second time he understood something without the guidance of someone else.\n\"So, you really don’t intend to explain anything to me?\" the System grumbled.\n\"Yup,\" Benjamin answered crisply.\n\"....\""

That would be of no use, as he was not even thirsty.\nBenjamin started to sense his consciousness space. He did not go into the space; instead he maintained the state of half-entering the space, where he felt the deep abyss of his space while also keeping his consciousness tethered to the real world.\nThat was a miraculous state, as he was stepping into the space of consciousness but also withholding himself with willpower to keep his sight in the real world.

The process was like tearing through space and time, and the absorption of the water particles was done within a blink of an eye. There was no chronological progression for the process, and it felt unimaginable.\nBenjamin could not contain his elation.\nHe successfully found a way to absorb the water particles!\nWith every attempt of taking in the water particles, a slight chill would run down his body, as if it was congratulating his success. It was so thrilling that Benjamin could not help but shudder.\nAt the urging of this feeling, and without putting in too much thought, Benjamin allowed his senses to sweep the cellar again and again like an addict. He absorbed every single drop of water particle into the space of his consciousness.\nAs he retreated from his half-mind-half-reality state, he took a deep breath and was filled with a comforting feeling.\n\"Ah, this was better than a happy ending!\" He sighed, sated."

Here, don’t be frugal with your words, praise me the best you can!\" Apparently, Benjamin did not listen to what the System said, as he was still deep in his admiration towards his own mental prowess.\nThe System was quiet for a while, and as if it was finally enraged, it raised its volume three times higher than before and bellowed in Benjamin’s ear like a heavy metal concert.\n\"NO ONE WANTED TO PRAISE YOU! YOUR METHOD FAILED!\"\nBenjamin was stunned by the voice, but he steadily regained his awareness as he frowned and asked, \"What did you just say?\"\nThe System calmed down and spoke in a normal volume, \"No one wanted to praise you, your method failed.\"\nBenjamin did not take it seriously, and assumed that the System was misbehaving as usual.\nHe asked again, \"Where did it go wrong?\"\nThe System answered, \"You will know why I’m telling you this once you return and observe the space of your consciousness.\"\nBenjamin considered the staid tone of the System and realised that it was not pulling his leg.

Benjamin was diligently absorbing water particles for such a long time before, thus the stored amount of water particles should be much more than it was before!\nWhere did all the water particles go?\n\"They leaked away when you were busy being pleased at yourself,\" the System provided him an answer. \"Leaked away? Why would they leak away?\" Benjamin was disillusioned. His efforts were wasted, and he felt the pain of the loss.\n\"Aren’t you a genius? Why are you asking me now?\" The System seemed to have learnt a thing or two from the madame. Its ability in mocking people improved fiercely.\nBenjamin did not care about the criticism. Instead, he furrowed his brows and mumbled to himself, \"Something must be wrong. What was the reason behind the leak? Hmm…\"\nHe had a feeling that the real answer was just right there in his head.

Why would they stay?\"\nAs Benjamin was pondering, the System grabbed the opportunity to ruthlessly retaliate.\nAt this point, Benjamin could not pay attention to the words of the System as he was deep in his thoughts. He was replaying the whole training method and the space of his consciousness in his mind. He felt that his reasoning was right, and theoretically, it was highly possible for him to execute a workable method out of it.\nHowever, the method had a fatal flaw.\nWhere was the problem?\n\"Why….\" He instinctively mumbled.\n\"Why, why, why oh why, why wouldn’t they leak out, why wouldn’t they?\" The System imitated Benjamin’s tone and made up rhymes to pester him.\nProbably because the System’s chants had a rhythm to it, it was good enough to make Benjamin to absentmindedly echo, \"Why…. why…. Why wouldn’t they leak out…\"\nWhy… Wouldn’t they leak out?\nBenjamin experienced a Eureka Moment.\nRight, the excess water particles did leak out and dissipate, but what about the remaining water particles? Why would they not leak out? What did he do that made them stay in his space, and did not leak alongside the other water particles?\nAs he changed his way of thinking, Benjamin realized that the answer he was pursuing was just right before his eyes.\nHe raised his eyes to gaze at the blue light before him. The pale blue hue reflected on his face as a smile of realization filled his face.\nHow could he forget this blue symbol?\nThe triangular magical emblem was the source of everything. It was it that unlocked the space of his consciousness, that gathered the active water particles, that gave Benjamin the power to sense the ‘water’ element, that allowed Benjamin to be able to summon a water ball.\nIt was the reason that the water particle stayed. When the space was overloaded by water particles that was out of the capacity of the symbol, it could not keep the water particles in the space. The excess water particles thus dissipated right after that.\nAs he understood all this, Benjamin immediately altered the method of training he had: the accumulation of water particles was not the key to become stronger, instead it was to strengthen the powers of the blue symbol, so that it could control a larger amount of water particles.\nThe way to strengthen the symbol, however….\nBenjamin thought for a moment and came up with an idea. He suddenly controlled a patch of water particle in the space and moved them towards the symbol. Controlling them without a medium was still quite difficult, which caused the travelling speed to be slow. After immense effort from Benjamin, they were finally near the symbol.\nUnder his command, the water particles touched the symbol.\nA loud ring rose emitted from the symbol!

However, he was quick to stop frowning, and again aimed at the water particles gathered in his surrounding. He commanded them again to levitate towards the blue symbol.\nThis time, the water particles came in contact with the symbol, but nothing happened. Benjamin only saw the water particles bleed into the symbol like rivers merging into the sea.\nThe symbol glowed momentarily, and returned to normal.\nBenjamin did not let disappointment cloud him. He repeated this action, and felt that he already solved the mystery between the space and the blue symbol. All that was left to do was to use practical methods to prove his hypothesis.\nAgain and again, he commanded the water particles to go near the symbol and be absorbed by it.

Although this process was extremely repetitive, he delved his mind and soul into it. He could not feel the passage of time.\nThis enchanting feeling deepened his confidence in his hypothesis. This feeling was very similar to the time when he first witnessed magic. It was as if something was calling out to him in the universe. If he was not on the right track, he would never feel this.\nOnce again, he raised his head and gazed at the glittering blue symbol in the space of his consciousness.\nHowever, that was not enough. He looked at the symbol as he prepared to start his final test.\nAs he waited for the water particles to form in the space, he took a brief rest. It was approximately 30 minutes for the water particles in the surroundings to recover. It even looked much concentrated than before.\nHe reached out his hand, aimed towards the symbol, and chanted the Waterball Spell.\nAccompanied by a ‘ding’ noise and the movements of the water particles, a water ball floated above his palm, and it was at least double the size of the previous water balls.\nBenjamin glanced at the big water ball in his hand, and finally showed a satisfied smile.\nHowever, the meaning behind the water ball was much more important than the water ball itself."

On the white bedsheet was a white envelope, and it was sealed perfectly, with no traces of being opened previously.\nWhen Benjamin saw this, his heart dropped as he remembered something.\n\"Dear God, please don’t let me be a jinx.\"\nBenjamin nervously inhaled and lifted the envelope to study it. Despite his best hopes, the worst had happened. At the back of the white envelope, a nightmarish name was etched on it with a black ball pen.\nMichelle.\nBenjamin’s eyesight went dark for a second. With a hopeful heart, he scrutinized the envelope for another 2 times to ensure that he did not mistake the name due to the bad handwriting. The result was still disappointing, as the words was indeed ‘Michelle’, no doubts.\nWas this karma?\nTo be able to place this envelope under Benjamin’s pillow despite being watched by the church, he must admit that Michelle’s tactics were surprisingly good. However, this was not good news for Benjamin.\nAfter he confirmed with the System that he did not know anyone else named ‘Michelle’, he started regretting making up the story to bluff the Pope."

Michelle used one short sentence to cut off Benjamin’s possibility to seek help from the church. It would be impossible for him to pass this to the Pope now, as if the Pope saw this line, he would immediately know about Benjamin’s magic. His death will be swifter than light itself, and he would suffer from the evil witch’s intention alone.\nIt was as if Michelle could read his mind, and that stressed him out.\nAt that moment, Benjamin realized that he was still in hot soup. No, it actually worsened. At least before this, Michelle had no idea that he could use magic, and he utilized that to thwart Michelle and successfully returned to the Lithurs. Now, Michelle already started to use this against him.\nWould Michelle really teach him magic?\nMaybe she would, maybe she would not. Regardless of her choice, she still had Benjamin’s life grasped firmly within her palms. The only way for him to escape her command was for her to break the curse she buried within him. Or else, he could only follow her every whim.\nWithin this short period of time, Benjamin’s shirt was soaked in cold sweat.\nThe game of death had started once again.\nBenjamin’s heart jumped, and quickly stuffed the envelope and letter under his pillow to prevent people from noticing that something was wrong.

He followed through with the question: \"Did anything weird happen when this letter appeared, and why didn’t it immolate now like the first one did?\" Benjamin was caught off guard.\nOops, he seemed to have forgot.\nIn order to gain the bishop's trust, when he fabricated Michelle's \"first letter\" he said that the letter burnt away on its own after he read it. However, this letter now did not burn away immediately after it was done being read, which cast some suspicion on his story.\nWhy did the first letter spontaneously combust and not this one?\nThis was not a tiny problem. Benjamin felt regret for not having thought of this before.\nAlthough the bishop’s questioning didn’t sound very serious, Benjamin was sure if he didn’t deal with this problem, it will definitely cause the bishop to doubt him. No one believes in a person who contradicts himself.\nAt this moment, countless thoughts raced through Benjamin's head over and over again. He had to answer this question and not show any hesitation while doing it. If the bishop saw him hesitate, it is was worse than giving an terrible answer.\nIt was too late to think now, so he made an ignorant expression, and replied:\n\"Uh ... this, I do not know why, why did it not burn up like the one previously?\""

When he finally woke up, it was already noon the next day.\nHe was awakened by a person.\n\"Benjamin! Wake up now, we have to go!\"\nBenjamin opened his sleepy eyes, he was still in a confused state.\n\"Get up, don’t sleep anymore, we’re going to be late!\" The noisy voice still echoed in his ear, but the word \"late\" made him think of his life before he teleported, so he woke up.\nLate? What am I late for?\nDarn, I thought I was late for morning classes.\nBenjamin rubbed his eyes and looked around. He saw a young man of similar age and looks standing next to the bed, forcefully shaking his shoulder.\nIt was his brother - Grant Lithur.\n\"What…...What are you doing?\"\nBenjamin was confused.\nAccording to the System, Grant had a good relationship with him. Grant did not look down on him just because he was a loser. But because Benjamin had not communicated with Grant before, the situation now was completely out of his expectations.\nIn addition to what he was clamoring about being \"late\", what did the \"leaving\"...mean?\n\"Have you forgotten? We’re going to war with them today, please don’t delay anymore, we’re going to be late!\" Grant continued urging without hesitation.\nGoing, going to war?\nBenjamin’s eyes flew wide open while he stared blankly at Grant.

Don’t go back to sleep, hurry up!\" Grant did not disappear like a dream would, but he shook the shoulders of Benjamin even harder, to the point Benjamin almost puked out his stomach acid.\nBenjamin sat up again from the bed and opened his eyes.\n\"I'm not dreaming?\" he asked.\n\"No.\" Grant replied.\n\"...\"\nBenjamin did not know what to say, he was not feeling very well.\nHe felt like after he came to this world, the situation to which he has woken up to has not been proper. It was first a kidnapping by a witch, followed by the encounter with a somnambulist in the middle of the night. It was even worse this time – he has to go war after waking up. How long has he been asleep?\nWas he really going to war?\n\"Don’t dawdle anymore, hurry and get up! Get up get up get up ... ...\"\n\"I'm up! Don’t shake me anymore, I’m about to puke!\""

It’s my turn to act stupid!\" kind of feeling.\n\"What do you want?\" He asked Dick.\nAt the same time, when he was pretending, he asked the system: \"Who’s that gigantic person next to Dick?\nMaster yourself, master the enemy.

Don’t go!\" Dick was so angry that he was missing such a good opportunity for revenge, so he shouted at once, and said, \"Conte, hurry, don’t let them leave!\"\nHe continued standing next to Dick and staring at Dick, but did not move.

However, he used the inertia of his body, very decisively sprang towards Dick, his hands grasping the hands of Dick holding the gun.\n\"Hand over the gun!\" He cried fiercely.\nBenjamin did not want to become a ‘shitman’, nor did he want to be shot in the head.\nSo he chose to gamble!\nDick could not react in time, and wanted to dodge. Panicking, the two fell to the ground, he and Benjamin wrestled. Benjamin desperately wanted to snatch Dick's gun, Dick was half angry and half instinctively trying to fight back. Unfortunately, Benjamin's physical capacity was not great. Despite his hard effort, he did not succeed.\nThe two refused to give in. The scene was extremely confusing.\n\"You two ... I …...\" Grant had dispersed the divine arts that gathered in his hands, looking at the two tangled together, he wanted to stop them, but did not know how to start, so he hesitated, and could only let them continue.\nSuddenly there was a gunshot.\nBang!\nTheir actions stopped at the same time.\nBenjamin's face, suddenly showing pain. He pushed Dick away and stood up, and then clutching his stomach, he collapsed.\nDick also stood up in horror, watching Benjamin with a painful expression rolling on the ground. He froze, like handling a red hot iron, he threw the gun far away, helplessly watching beside Grant.\n\"I, I did not intend to shoot ... it was not, he rushed at me, I, I ...…\nGrant was also frightened by the sudden turn of events, he looked at the Benjamin who was rolling in pain, but did not know what to do.\nIt was not long before the other \"corpses\" in the castle were alerted by the gunshot. They looked at the absurd and horrifying scene here, and could not help but be scared soulless.\nOnly a few aristocratic children were smart enough to shout, \"Go get the patrol!\" They ran out of the castle, to seek for help. Dick saw these people, exposing his will to want to stop them, but hesitated, and eventually did nothing."

Just go and find him, then tell him that he would know.\"\nIt would be a miracle if the carpenter understood, as Benjamin had no idea what he was saying either. He was this close to not knowing the word ‘understand’.\nJeremy was clearly confused as he stood staring at the ceiling for a long moment. Then, he snapped back into reality and asked Benjamin in a slightly mortified tone, \"Now?\"\nBenjamin nodded and looked at Jeremy affectionately, \"Now.\"\nJeremy was stunned, but he did not complain about how late it was, or how far the route was. He just nodded dumbly and walked out of the room, dragging his heavy steps behind him. He felt empty.\nRumor has it that after that night, the carpenter at the East of the kingdom suddenly fell ill and closed his shop. He did not leave his room for a month, and everyone who saw him said that he suffered from a high fever and was mumbling in his sleep, \"I don’t understand…. I don’t understand….\"\nOf course, that happened much later. At this moment, Benjamin sent Jeremy away in the night, made sure the doors and windows were locked properly, and no one would interrupt him again.\nHe withdrew the book from under the covers, held it the way an avid believer would with the actual Holy Bible, and took a deep breath. At last.\nHe could finally learn magic outside of the Waterball Spell. What else could he say?\nThat was the first sentence Benjamin saw after he flipped open the cover page. As expected, the content after that was the mages’ version on how the magic and the divine arts originated. It was another version of Cain and Abel’s story.\nIn this story, there was no devil. There was only the God of Magic and the God of Light. They blessed two mortals each with the power of magic and divine arts. The antagonist in this story was the perilous environment and the mighty magical beasts. Cain and Abel cleared the wastelands and led the human race to build a place that they could call their home.\nHowever, as stories go, good times will never be long. The brothers had a conflict over the sacrificial ceremony, where the God of Magic favored grains and vegetables, so Cain insisted that all sacrifices should be grains and vegetables. On the other hand, the God of Light preferred cows and lambs, so Abel wanted all sacrifices to be likewise. The followers of both parties had increasing clashes too. One day, the brothers finally broke apart, and they had a battle in a valley.\nWhen the battle reached its climax, two beams of holy light descended from the sky. The God of Light and God of Magic made themselves known. They were saddened by the fratricidal behaviors of the humans, and thus killed Cain and Abel with the divine punishment. They declared that they would never step foot on this land ever again, which was why the land was called ‘the Abandoned Land of Gods’, the battlefield named ‘The Abandoned Valley of Gods’."

Abel’s followers were more skilled in winning over the support of the people. They built the church and expanded on the land; Cain’s followers gradually became isolated, and was dismissive towards the practice of banding together. Hence, the church took the advantage and started a massacre of the mages. Finally, the land became what it is today.\nAfter he finished the mages’ story, Benjamin felt that this version was more objective than the church’s version. It did not contain any discredits to the opposing faction too. However, the Rashomon effect dictated that as long as someone was involved in the story, his narrative will never be totally objective. Therefore, he finished the story with the spirit of investigation and query.\nAt this moment, his mind was no longer wandering in this mayhem of a legend.\nThese spells were written phonetically using similar sounding words, and it was as easy as translating \"good morning\" into mandarin literally according to the pronunciations. If it was not for the detailed analysis of the pronunciations of the spell under the transcriptions, Benjamin would be very suspicious of the accuracy of the spells. Additionally, as Benjamin knew the incantations of the Waterball Spell and the Binding Spell, he inferred that he would be able to grasp the pronunciations of the other spells without making any mistakes.\nBenjamin was quite disappointed.\nHe did not mean to say that spells are bad, but he had higher expectations.\nHe was slightly worried too. What if under the long period of suppression by the church, the standard of magic on all lands was only empirical? What if the mages only knew how to memorize and regurgitate spells, but did not manage to innovate an advanced methodology? What can he do then?\nIf that was really the case, he would be the bellwether in the field of magical theory....\nAfter a brief period of disappointment, Mr. Bellwether decided to retain his spirit of academic pursuit. He went into the space of his consciousness, and started experimenting the 50+ spells he just learnt.\nHe started with the spells that had no relations with ‘water’. One by one he chanted: Fireball Spell, Numbing Spell, Latent Image Spell…. The results were the same. A repelling force was felt from the space, and sometimes even the wandering particles started to protest, as if they were saying, \"The one you’re chanting is my enemy! Shut up, or else I’ll choke you to death!\"\nHe was left with no choice but to pick a Water Barrier Spell, and chanted after confirming the pronunciations and focused all of his attention. A wave propagated from his body.\nThe surrounding water particles stirred and slowly had a tendency to gather. However, when the particles were halfway through the gathering process, Benjamin suddenly felt an immense pain in his brain as the energy wave dissipated and the water particles stopped gathering.\nThe spell failed."

Therefore, he repeatedly summoned the water barrier, and he finally succeeded after more than 10 failures.\nIt was a steaming thin membrane that enveloped him like a bubble. He felt a refreshing feeling as if his heart and mind connected. He gazed at this barrier that looked so fragile, and could not help but poke at it with his finger.\nThe bubble popped as it burst.\nDamn, it was really fragile….\nThat could not be helped either. This was the first time he had casted the spell, and it was very tiring due to its unfamiliarity. Benjamin could only comfort himself using this line of reason. Then, with the determination he had when he looped the spells before, he started practicing this spell again and again.\nIt was very exhausting for him to repeat an unfamiliar spell, especially after numerous failures. After another round of failures, he was once again ejected from the space of his consciousness.\nThe success rate for this spell was 5 out of uncountable trials. It was obvious that it would be impossible for him to deploy this spell in actual combat when the success rate was so low.\nAt first, Benjamin was dismayed. Despite all that, he managed to calm himself down thanks to his thirst for knowledge, which was instilled in him by modern education. He thought about the cause for the failures. The Waterball Spell was deployed for an infinite amount of times in his space, and the success rate was 100% with minimal drainage of energy. Although the Water Barrier Spell was slightly complicated than the Waterball Spell, it was impossible for it to be so arduous!\nWhat was the problem?\nWhen he compared the incantations for the Waterball Spell and the Water Barrier Spell, Benjamin finally found his answer.\nEverything was due to the glittering blue symbol in the space of his consciousness.\nWhen he was chanting the Waterball Spell, the symbol would vibrate and emit waves to guide these water particles. And when he was casting the Water Barrier Spell, the symbol was not involved in the process, and he could only rely on himself to give out a wave. Thus, his control over the water particles dropped drastically too.\nOnce he understood this, another bigger problem surfaced. Why did the symbol not react when he chanted the symbol? In other words, what should he do to let the symbol help him in casting spells aside from the Waterball Spell?\nAs he returned to the space, he tried the other spells that were related to water: the Water of Life, the Freezing Spell, Ice-Breaking Spell, the Misting Spell …. All of them had similar results with the Water Barrier. The triangular symbol was just like the door in the story of Alibaba, the Waterball Spell its ‘Open Sesame’. Other than that, it would not bother reacting.\nIf he was honest, how could it be possible for him to understand the mechanisms of the symbol when he had no idea what the symbol even was? As the bellwether of the field in magical theory, his research was all on the process of magic. He still needed to investigate more in order to know how everything works."

When have my research results been wrong?\"\n\"….\"\nWhen he heard this answer, he felt less convinced.\nAfter some thought, he decided it would be better if he tested this theory.\nIf the divine arts and magic are fundamentally the same, it would mean that he could learn both. On top of that, all the theories in divine arts could also be replicated and used in magic.\nUndoubtedly, the divine arts were much more advanced than magic. He could borrow the theories of the divine arts and apply them on his magical training! That would be much better than him wallowing in frustration trying to learn it by himself.\nAt last, he saw a path before him again.\nOf course, all of this could only be true if magic and divine arts were indeed the same.

        "output": "In a second, Benjamin finally understood. He was relieved. Here he was, wondering what it was! It scared the living lights out of him, when it was just…. Just….\nGrant’s snores paused for a second before it returned to normal, as if he really was asleep and dead to the world.\nBenjamin smirked and strolled out of Grant’s bedroom. He was even considerate enough to close the door behind him.\n\"What happened? Why did you do that? Why did I not understand anything I just saw?\" The System jumped out and asked dumbly.\n\"Ah, stop pretending. I saved almost 1TB of action movies in your hard drive, stop trying to look pure and innocent,\" Speechless, Benjamin retorted.\nThe System was quiet, then it emitted a mechanical sound that resembled a creepy and filthy snicker.\nSo, although there was a ‘hiccup’, Benjamin still got the things he wanted and went safely back into his room. He crawled back to his bed and tucked the Holy Bible - Mage Version away, then flipped open Divine Arts 101.\nIn contrast to the mages’ brochure for revolution, the DIvine Arts 101 was meticulously edited. It was more systematic, and had an abundance of content. The introduction cut straight into the nature of the divine arts. Divine arts utilizes spiritual energy to communicate with the holy light scattered in the environment, and used god’s power as a medium to cast unimaginable divine spells.\nThis was similar with Benjamin’s understanding of magic - substitute ‘holy light’ with ‘water particles’, and ‘god’s power’ to ‘nature’s power’, and it would be exactly the same. This basically proved the System’s reasoning of ‘Divine Arts is Magic’.\nBenjamin continued reading. The book listed out the qualities for a person to be able to learn divine arts. Benjamin could not help but recall that the System once told him that he was found through tests to have zero talents in the divine arts.\nIf divine arts was magic, why then would he have the talent to learn magic?\nIn the book, it was written that in order for a person to learn divine arts, the individual must possess these 2 qualities: strong spiritual energy and high affinity to the holy light. If the spiritual energy was weak, the divine arts will fail easily; if the affinity to the holy light was low, then it would be difficult for the individual to gather the holy light. Neither of the elements can be absent.\nIf he were to translate that to magic, it would probably mean the need for spiritual energy and affinity to the water element.\nAfter he questioned the System, Benjamin found out that he was extremely weak in both qualities during the initial test. That was why he was judged to have no talent in the divine arts. However, magic needed spiritual energy too, and if he had low spiritual energy, how did he manage to learn magic in the first place?\n\"Hmm…. that was probably why you could not seem to learn these spells no matter how hard you try,\" the System suddenly said."

        "output": "It did not take long for it to dawn on Benjamin. No wonder he could not seem to succeed in summoning the water barrier. His spiritual energy was weak! When it came to the affinity to water, if he compared himself to what was described in the book, he probably did not do good in that department too.\nThis result did not delight Benjamin whatsoever. This meant that Benjamin would never be able to learn magic like those who were gifted.\nHe glanced at the space of his consciousness and the symbol within. He understood now that it was useless for him to ask Michelle about magic. He could only make his own path, and fully explore this dark technology.\nThankfully, as Benjamin read on, Divine Arts 101 introduced a special scenario. In this case, even if the individual did not have a good spiritual energy and affinity, he/she could still learn the divine arts and could even achieve a very high standard.\nIn the book, this was called ‘Unlocking the Zone of Prayer and Condensing the Crest of Holy Light’.\nBenjamin’s eyes widened. At last.\nAfter he scanned the next few lines of the introduction, he was sure that the ‘Zone of Prayer’ was the space of his consciousness, and the ‘Crest of Holy Light’ was the magical emblem.\nThe book did not give much explanation about this. It only said that this method was extremely risky as it was easy to be attacked by evil forces and become paralysed when one was unlocking the Zone of Prayer. Besides, not many people actually knew how to unlock the Zone, and the ones who actually did it came to it by coincidence. Historically, only a few people were successful in this endeavour.\nBenjamin recalled his experience, and had an urge to clarify that losing one’s mind is not related to evil forces at all. It only meant that one was lost in some space in the consciousness and unable to escape.\nHowever, after it talked about the cons of this method, it followed with the pros. The Zone of Prayer could store the floating holy lights. The release of the divine arts takes an extremely short time, some can even cast spells using only their minds. With the Crest of the Holy Light, the divine arts will be much stronger and easier to control than usual. Furthermore, if you have the Zone of Prayer, you do not need to train your spiritual energy the hard way. You would not even face a limit, you just need to strengthen the Crest within.\nAfter all this, the book also stated that the 4th Pope used this method to train himself. He was also the Pope who completed the unification of the Kingdom of Helius, the ‘Son of God’ who truly led the church to its peak.\nBenjamin would be lying if he were to say that he was not excited. This paragraph basically told him that the path he was on would lead him somewhere good. As long as he put in effort, he would be a great person in this generation.\nNot only was he excited, he was grateful too.\nAfter all, according to the book, only 1 in a million people was able to unlock the Space."

If it did not put the spell on loop, he would not be able to get into the space of his consciousness completely by accident, and he would also not be able to get out of the Space.\nBenjamin had a lot of hope for his future now. He held the book and continued reading.\nHowever, when he came to the training part of the chapter, his elated heart plummeted to the floor. It was as if a bucket of cold water was poured down his face.\nBack in the original world when he played computer games, the most important factor to him was not the graphics nor the plotline but the skills. As long as there was a myriad of strange and imaginative skills, he would love that game. He was also not too interested in advancing to higher levels in the game. Everything he did was for the purpose of learning a new skill, and every time he succeeded in doing so, his sense of accomplishment would be off the charts.\nNow….\nHow could it be that after finally teleporting into a world of magic, he was told that he could only have 3 skills? And one of it was wasted on the goddamned Waterball Spell?\n\"Clear this account, I want to delete it,\" he looked forlornly at the sky as if he was speaking to someone.\n\"You should also know that no one would reply you, and this would only show how immature you are,\" the System chided him.\nBenjamin was quiet for a moment before he laughed at himself, \"Who said no one was going to reply me, didn’t you just do exactly that?\"\nThe System seemed to not get the joke, \"I’m not even a human.\"\nBenjamin sighed. He stretched, cheered himself up, and once again picked up Divine Arts 101.\nIf it was really 3 skills, then so be it! He could not really delete this account and start over, right?\nAfter all, the 4th Pope only used 3 skills to change the face of the church, right?\nBenjamin believed that as long as it was used properly, water could also be a strong weapon.\nJust like that, Benjamin accepted the fact that he could only learn 3 spells in his life. He used his optimism to once again lead himself into the calm state of learning, and he continued reading Divine Arts 101.\nIn the book, the last part of this paragraph revealed details on the method to enhance the Crest of Holy Light and condense new Crests. The enhancing procedures were similar to Benjamin’s ‘meditation’, so he merely scanned through those pages. His priority laid with the sections on the method to condense new Crests.\nThe book mentioned that in order to condense the Crests of Holy Light, the individual will need to continuously accumulate and compress the stored Holy Lights in the Zone of Prayer. This process should be repeated until the light materializes, then the person would just need to chant the divine spell of his/her choosing at the materialized light. The second new Crest would then be formed.\nIf he changed this narrative to the perspective of magic, this was basically the accumulation and compression of water particles, right?\nHmm, it did not sound too difficult to execute.\nAfter he read this part, he put down the book and started practicing without any delay."

This process was very similar with meditation, and the water particles in the Space did start moving under his command, albeit rather slowly.\nEverything seemed to be proceeding smoothly without any hiccups.\nHowever, Benjamin soon found a new problem: It was too slow!\nDue to his low affinity with the water particles, the process was moving at the pace of a snail. For him to reach the level of materialization as described by the book, he did a calculation and estimated that he would need another year of ceaseless work.\nFuck, a year? Although the year would only be approximately half a month in real life terms, it was still unacceptable.\nBenjamin tried to stop directing the water particles. Immediately, the particles dispersed.\nThis thing does not function like the Xunlei Thunder Download Manager, where a few KB/s of download speed was acceptable because it would accumulate as long as you put it in the background. The download would probably take ten to fifteen days, but it would finish regardless. However, this requires Benjamin’s full attention, as once he lost his focus, he could only start over.\nIf he stayed in the Space for that long of a time, he would probably become a dry corpse in real life!\nNo, there must be another way to this.\nAfter some contemplation, he suddenly had an idea. First, he casted a Waterball Spell in the space of his consciousness, and once the water ball was formed, he did not let it dissipate. Instead, he used it as a centre and guided the water particles to go towards the water ball.\nThis was his idea. If he could not keep the gathered water particles together, he could just produce something akin to a nucleus to reel the water particles in.\nAs the first water particle came into contact with the water ball, a soft ‘ding’ was heard somewhere within the space.\nBenjamin once again found himself in the blue world, with countless symbols orbiting around him like a lively universe. This time, he stayed much longer in this world than he did last time, but it was still not long enough for him to take a clear look before he was once again back in the dark space of his consciousness.\nHe was stunned for a moment before he recovered.\n\"Did I succeed?\"\nHe asked as he looked at the levitating water ball, his face brightened in surprise and delight as he realized what he was looking at.\nThe water ball was functioning like a magnet, slowly but steadily attracting the water particles around it. He did not deliberately guide the water particles when he was stunned, and yet the water particles still voluntarily gathered towards the water ball like ants going back to their nests.\nThe problem that haunted him just moments before was solved.\nThis was not a water ball, this was literally the floating window for Xunlei Thunder Download Manager!\nBenjamin was as delighted as a man who found a treasure."

In other words, there was not much difference in learning beginner-level spells or master-level spells. The worst was just that it sounded uncool.\nAdditionally, Benjamin had to learn new spells as fast as possible as he was in a hurry to improve his abilities. Thus, he could only choose from the existing beginner-level spells he had around him.\nInitially, he wanted to learn the Water Barrier Spell to possess some level of defense, since he could increase his attack powers by strengthening the Waterball Spell. He would leave the last skill for a suitable spell that he may encounter in the future.\nHowever, he changed his mind when he saw the water ball that was gathering the water particles around it.\nThis water ball was not an average water ball.\nBenjamin realised the ‘no limits’ that was written in the book had a deeper meaning. It was not only about enhancing the spell to the point where one water ball could flood the city; instead, it was to give the water ball unlimited possibilities.\nThe water ball could do whatever the water barrier could do. After all, a hollowed water ball would become a bubble, and if there was enough compressed water particles in the bubble, its defense powers can’t be too bad.\nThe same applies to the Water of Life. As long as he formed the water ball with a specific molecular structure, it could become a water ball with healing effects.\nAll in all, not only could he increase damage and decrease cooling time for the spell, he could also attribute qualities of defense, healing, and control that are effective in combat to the water ball as long as he strengthened the symbols and improved his Waterball skills.\nIf he were to think strategically, having 3 spells would be excessive now as the Waterball Spell could cover almost all of the different scenarios in battle. The Waterball is great, the Waterball is almighty; what use would a Water Barrier Spell be?\nSuddenly, he felt that the 3 spells may be a hint for him.\nHe needed to do another experiment.\nHe summoned another water ball by chanting the spell, but this time he attempted to control the water ball to change its state. The water ball compressed, expanded, and became a bubble like a barrier, turned into a bird and a fish…. The water ball transformed in his hand, and Benjamin enjoyed playing with it.\nHe realised how amazing of a spell Waterball Spell was."

He could change anything - shapes, durability, volume, density, or even its properties as long as Benjamin has a strong enough magical symbol to back him up.\nHe could transform the water ball into all that, aside from one thing - to change the water ball to become not a water ball.\nThis finding sent Benjamin back in time to his Physics classes during Junior High. The teacher gave him a quiz with a question: What are the 3 states of water? When the other kids were scratching their heads, Benjamin wrote down confidently, ‘Solid, Liquid, Gas’.\nFate works in mysterious ways, and he found it hard to believe that this memory would come back to him in this way.\nHow should he choose his 3 spells?\nHe did this question before. This was a bonus question for him.\nHe quickly found 2 suitable spells among the 50+ in the Holy Bible: the Ice-breaking Spell and the Pillar of Steam. According to the introduction, the Ice-breaking Spell attacks via shards of ice, while the Pillar of Steam would injure the enemies by summoning hot steam.\nThe Holy Bible defined them as attack spells, which is in the same category with the Waterball Spell. However, in Benjamin’s eyes, they were given unlimited possibilities.\nBenjamin also had a gut feeling that once these 3 magical emblems were successfully materialized, they would result in new combinations due to interactions with each other.\nThe 3 states of ‘water’ combined sounded very impressive.\nBenjamin’s confidence rose after he decided on the spells he wanted. He felt that he made the correct choices, and that something has secretly changed after he made this decision.\nIf there was really a wheel of fortune, it must have had a new parameter just minutes ago.\nThis world will change, and that would be all due to him.\nBenjamin suddenly shook his head and chuckled at himself, emerging from the cloud of optimism and purpose.\nHe really had an active imagination. What he should do now was to focus on solving the problems laid in front of him.\nBenjamin finally had a few days of peace. Like clockwork, he woke up, took his meals, sent Jeremy on errands, and never stepped foot out of the manor. The incessant incidents finally stopped, and his father, Claude, was still patrolling in the fief. The people in the manor were living in harmony too, as they bid their hellos and goodbyes daily but did not converse much with each other.\nHe returned Divine Arts 101 to Grant’s study table right after he finished the book.

Benjamin was contented.\nHowever, he also knew that his peaceful days would not last for long.\nWhat he did not expect was that the person who would interrupt his peaceful, self-cultivating life was his father, Claude.\nAs soon as Claude arrived home from the fief, he summoned Benjamin to his study room first thing in the morning.\n\"Your mind is getting more barbaric day by day. If things don’t change, should I expect a showdown between you and the other nobles happening in the near future?\" Claude, with his hands behind his back, yelled at Benjamin once the he stepped into the room.\nSo, Claude heard about the farce that was the ‘war-simulation game’ between the young nobles, huh. Benjamin felt dumb.\nWas he not the victim in the situation? Why would Claude scold him? Benjamin was not the one who brought the gun! The one to blame should be Dick, why was he the one who was responsible for this? Does Claude not act upon logic?\nOf course, he would not show all these emotions on his face. He recognised what he should do in this situation, which was to square his jaw, lower his face and stand still until Claude was satisfied with the yelling he had. Then, he would be let out of the house. After all, this was just a tiny issue in his life, and would not have any major impact in his life.\nAlthough he did correctly guess the process, but he never would have expected the ending.\nAfter Claude finished reprimanding him, he stayed silent for a moment before telling Benjamin abruptly, \"This was all because you’re pampered since you’re young! You never endured hardships before, and that made you who you are today. I contacted my friends in the army, and from today onwards, you will follow them and train in the military every morning. Then, you would not laze around in bed and refuse to wake up too.\"\nBenjamin was stunned.

Don’t worry, I have no intentions of running, but I just woke up and didn’t have the time to eat anything, and I’m starving now,\" Benjamin pleaded.\nHe really did not plan to escape. If he did, Claude would be so angry he would probably disown Benjamin and kick him out of the house. Thus, although he really wanted to stay in his room to train, he did not dare to protest.\nBenjamin really did want to get some food to fill his stomach. He was basically sent to the military training now, and who knows what surprising activities the army training had in store for him? He dare not let down his guard, as judging from Claude’s expressions, he was not joking around this time.\nMilitary training was fine, it was not as if he never experienced it; but if he was sent there with an empty stomach, it would be a tad bit cruel then.\nIf he was told to be at attention for 1 hour, then do 200 frog jumps and 300 push-ups, he would probably die from exhaustion before Michelle’s curse could even torture him to death.\nThus, his decision to ask for some food was the easiest and most reasonable one he could make.\nJessica’s answer was very simple, \"No.\"\n\"....\"\nBenjamin could not help but complain to the System, \"This woman is more difficult to communicate with than you are.\"\n\"....Sorry, I shouldn’t have said that,\" Benjamin deadpanned, \"I underestimated you. You’re more difficult to have a normal conversation with than she is.\"\nThe System grinned and said, \"That’s more like it.\"\nBenjamin spat out a mouthful of blood and died.\nWith the maid in front of him and the System in his brain, Benjamin had no means to stop anything, and was soon brought to the army base just like that.\nThe army base in Havenwright was in the inner city, and was close to the church, the area of nobles, and the castle. This was probably due to the numerous civil wars that occurred in the Kingdom before. In terms of combat ability, this army was known to be the elite of the elite, and had a high status within the hearts of the civilians and the nobles.\nAlthough this was just a military training, the fact that Claude could get Benjamin into this army was evidence of how close Claude was with his ‘friend in the army’. It was a well-known fact that the military never compromised for the nobles ever.\nAfter a brief meeting with the watchguard soldier at the doors of the army base, the maid completed her mission and left. Meanwhile, Benjamin was guided by a soldier clad in armour to the training grounds. Benjamin could not even see his face under the armour.\nBenjamin tried to talk to the soldier and ask for some food when they were on their way to the training grounds. However, the soldier ignored him throughout the way, which made the System ecstatic towards Benjamin’s predicament.\nWhen they reached the destination, the soldier finally said the first and last sentence to Benjamin, \"We’re here.\"\nBenjamin listened.

Benjamin had no choice but to clench his jaw and walk towards the group.\n\"What’s your name?\" The middle-aged man asked.\nBenjamin thought for a moment before intentionally leaving out his surname, \"I’m Benjamin.\"\nThe man curled his upper lip in a show of superiority, \"So you’re the brat from the Lithur family, the useless one, right?\"\nA laugh was heard from the crowd.\nBenjamin could feel how the stares of the crowd shifted the moment the word ‘Lithur’ was said. The stare of those surrounding him turned into those of envy and disdain.\nHe could only sigh deeply in his heart.\nThe military forces in the Kingdom of Helius held a special status, and they were not intimidated by the nobles, nor the royalties. Although they spoke of loyalty towards the country, but in actuality, they were only loyal to the church.\nThey are not be afraid of offending the nobles, as the nobles had no relations with them in any way. Thus, the nobles would find it difficult to find trouble with the army. Moreover, the army’s is backed by a much higher authority than those of a noble.\nBesides, according to their values, the nobles were the ones that they look down on the most, even more than the common folks. In their point of view, the citizens worked hard to put food on the table; the nobles however, were a bunch of leeches that would just sit around do nothing and are utterly useless.\nThus, it definitely will not be easy for a noble that had joined the army ranks by accident.\nAs Benjamin thought to himself, he began to study his surroundings. He noticed that this was not a normal training camp the moment he stepped into the place. A normal training camp would not be as narrow and long and the soldiers would not be wearing these weirdly bulky uniforms. Additionally, the camp grounds would not have a row of targets lined at one end of the field….\nHe came to a conclusion quickly: This is a gunfire training ground.\nClaude sent him here to learn shooting?\nBenjamin was dumbfounded. Claude would never do that! The incident in the castle was started by a gun, and Claude’s intention was for him to suffer through some hardships so he could learn to behave and not cause him more trouble. But to let Benjamin learn how to handle a gun, was he implying that Benjamin's trouble-making skills aren't strong enough as it is?\nNone of these make any sense!\n\"Alright, since this is a command from the top, I have no say in this matter.

He suddenly had a feeling that it probably was not Claude’s intention to put him in the gunfire training grounds.\nIt was probably the work of Claude’s ‘friend in the army’.\nSince he was born, it was no secret among the nobles that he was weak and susceptible to illnesses. At this point, the people in the military probably knew about it too. General Gray probably misunderstood Claude’s words and thought he wanted his child to learn something from the army. And after much consideration, General Gray had arranged for Benjamin to be sent to the gunfire training camp. Here at the gunfire training camp, there isn’t much intensive physical training that would exhaust Benjamin, and the thing about shooting is that even people with low stamina could do it. Benjamin could learn a thing or two here.\nThe fact that he could learn how to use a gun was right down Benjamin’s alley. This was a type of combat skill, and one which he’d be able to utilize openly in battle. As he will need to move around in the Kingdom in the future, he must be very careful about using his magic. Thus, it was not a waste of time for him to learn a combat skill that could be used out in the open.\nAlso, he quite liked the idea of learning how to use a gun. Who wouldn’t?\nHence, Benjamin decided to stay around for some time. Claude mentioned to only train in the mornings anyways, he would still have time to learn magic.\nAfter he thoroughly pondered on the matter, he faced the laughters of the crowd and answered calmly, \"Oh, guns. Of course, I’ve touched them before.\"\nHe did touch a gun when he was having a struggle with Dick. So technically, he wasn’t lying.\nNot only did he touch it, he was at the end of the barrel! Everyone here had probably shot a gun before, but aside from the middle-aged man who is likely the instructor, would have ever been pointed by a gun. After all, these recruits looked like newbies who had never been on the actual battlefield.\nA gunfire training ground for recruits. This General Gray really did put an effort in finding the right arrangement for Benjamin. If Benjamin ever had the chance to meet him in the future, he must gift him a Nao Baijin [1].\nThe laughter from the crowd gradually quieted down upon hearing Benjamin’s reply. It was as if the recruits had found a new toy and their faces were one of surprise and interest as they looked at Benjamin.\nThe middle-aged instructor did not say anything. He just chortled, and took out a pistol from around his waist and tossed it over to Benjamin.\n\"Since you’ve touched one before, show me by taking a shot with it,\" Said the instructor as he spoke with disinterest.\nThe instructor had tossed the gun so sudden that Benjamin was unable to react immediately.

I’m doing this for your own good, you’ll thank me soon enough!\" That was the middle-aged man - their inspector’s words.\nBenjamin could not help but barked in his heart, ‘The most dangerous person on this field is you! A gun without the safety clutch on your waist? If it went off, you’d be losing your balls or it’ll go through your anus.’\nHowever, it was only him — the half-assed ‘recruit’ that thought this way. Judging from the looks from other people’s face, they probably thought that the orders from the instructor was more important than a message from God, and whatever he do will always be right. They executed the task of obedience perfectly."

He was a mage, and if he didn’t have the ability to think independently and question everything, he might as well just go and join the church.\nHe was quickly called out by the instructor.\n\"The last one in the team, step out!\"\nBenjamin who had ran more than 10 rounds, was so exhausted that he nearly fainted when he walked towards the man.\n\"Weren’t you great just moments ago? What happened to that vigor of yours? The fastest person in the group ran almost 20 rounds now, what are you doing at the back?\" The instructor reprimanded him without any pauses, \"Where is your energy? Did you not eat?\"\nBenjamin panted as he bent over and supported himself on his knees. Once he recovered his breath, he said, \"I really didn’t eat…...\"\n\"Greet before you speak to your superiors! Say ‘Sir!’\" The instructor cut him off before he could finish his sentence, \"Go back! Come here again, and repeat your words!\"\n\"...\"\nBenjamin dragged his heavy steps and walked back to the running formation, before walking out and returning to stand before the instructor, and shouted with all his might.\n\"SIR! I REALLY DIDN’T EAT!\"\n\"...\"\nAn awkward silence blanketed the field.\nThe instructor nearly lost control over his stern expression, but after much effort he managed to maintain a straight and stern face. He roared at Benjamin, \"That is not an excuse! Will the enemy show mercy if he knew you didn’t eat? Go back and run! Don’t even dream of eating if you do not complete a 100 laps!\"\nIn the end, Benjamin left the army base lying down.\nBenjamin felt he had ran more in one morning than all of the running he ever did in combined. Thankfully, the maid that was sent to escort him had called a carriage to the entrance of the army base to take him back to the manor. Otherwise, he would have collapsed on his way home.\nAfter he arrived in the Lithur Manor, he did not have any energy to even walk to the living room and have lunch with everybody else. He could only muster energy to walk back to his room before collapsing onto his bed, unmoving. He told Jeremy to bring him some bread and tended to his hunger as he lied in bed.\nAs he finished the bread, he sent Jeremy away again on an errand. Being entirely alone in his room, he really wanted sleep right away.\nBut he didn’t. He mustered his mental energy and dived into the space of his consciousness, thus beginning his magical training for the day.\nThis had become a daily homework that he could no longer skip.\nDuring this period of meditation, the triangular symbol seemed to have changed. The light emitted from the symbol shifted from pale blue to dark blue, as if it had unlimited magical energy within it. The mysterious vibe from it was mesmerising. The water ball that was summoned through the symbol had also surpassed the size of that of Accius Fulner’s fat head.\nBenjamin estimated that if he had compressed this water ball and threw it, it could knock out a strong, grown man if he had no heavy armor on him."

        "output": "From face washing to punching people in the face, this spell was finally living up to its standard.\nNot only that, Benjamin felt that his control over magic had improved as the triangular symbol became stronger. The speed of his waterball summoning was also quicker, and he could maintain control over the water ball better than he ever did before.\nNow, he could manipulate the water ball skillfully to form a defence bubble around himself. Of course, the defence abilities of the bubble was still very much insufficient. Although it would not burst from just a poke, it would still crumble easily if it was sliced by a sharp object.\nBenjamin was far from satisfied with this. He was going to use this to fight the Pope! If it could not withstand normal knives and swords, what more defending against magic! This bubble could be broken by a simple knight, what more a Cleaner from the church?\nHe still needs to train!\nAs for the healing effects of the Waterball Spell, Benjamin also spent some time studying about it. He deliberately casted around 20 spells, and finally he successfully summoned a few drops of the Water of Life. He then observed and scrutinized the differences between the Water of Life and the Waterball Spell.\nUnder his observation, he found out that the water molecules in the Water of Life was held together in a very unique structure. It was somewhat like a strange cube. This unique structure construed of water molecules produces a strange life energy, and it was this life energy that brought about the healing effects of the Water of Life spell.\nBenjamin found out that it was very difficult for him to manipulate the water molecule at the molecular level. Thankfully with the help of the triangular symbol, he managed to successfully create a water ball with healing powers. However, it could only maintain its structure for approximately 10 seconds, before losing its healing traits once the time elapses.\nHe could only wait for the symbol to become stronger before he could form a healing water ball that can be stored for a longer time.\nAlthough the level for attack, defence, and healing was low, at least Benjamin had started training all of these aspects simultaneously. His new skill was just around the corner too! This was the period of rapid growth for his abilities.\nHe wished dearly that he could stop eating and sleeping to dedicate the whole of his time to cultivate his magic.\nOnly if he no longer need to go to military training.\nAlthough it would take a lot of his time, he was not opposed to the idea of military training due to the gunfire training. But judging from today’s training, he had a long way to go before he would be able to touch a gun, much less learning how to shoot. God knows how many more laps would he need to run before that happens.\n\"Oh, before I forget, how advanced are the guns in this world?\" Benjamin asked the System."

Do you think I know everything?\"\n\"... Okay then,\" Benjamin had no choice but to accept its reasonings. He was thinking of using any information that the System provided to him to improve a pistol and evolve it into a AK27 or something.\nHowever, it was also impossible for anyone to store this much useful information that would be needed in the event of a teleportation. How did the main characters in the teleportation novels manage to remember so many scientific theories from their original world? Why were they able to push the development of technology in their teleported world with just a flick of a finger when he could not even make a block of soap?\nThankfully, in an effort to prove its worth, the System provided information on the gun status in this world.\nIn this world where supernatural abilities are present, magic and the divine arts are the two dominant sources of power Not only referring to those in a battle, but also that applied on enchanted swords and knives, and the blessed armours. A normal bullet will never be able to pierce a blessed armour, much less the shield of the divine arts. The divine arts could also be used to bless bullets, but it was rarely deployed as it would drain too much power. Instead, it was used to bless the ammunition of the artilleries.\nAlso, it is useless to enchant pistols using divine arts or magic, unless you intend to use it to knock people.\nEven though many countries still had gunfire troops, they only function as long-distance backup soldiers and their status were lower than the artillery regiments.\nThus, pistols are usually used by agility-type mercenaries, or by the nobles and wealthy merchants as means of defence. Just like the gun Dick had on that day, which he most probably stole from his own house.\nThat was true when the pistol is in the hands of most people. . However, it is an entirely different scenario when a pistol is held by Benjamin.\nEquipped with the shooting system from the online games, shooting with a 100% accuracy was no problem to Benjamin. In the future, he could also learn more on enchantments that he could utilise on his shots. All in all, the ability to shoot was very valuable for him — at least during the time where his water ball is still relatively weak. Using a gun to shoot was still the most direct and efficient tactic he could deploy in an attack.\nOf course, the prerequisite for whatever that was said was for Benjamin to actually possess a gun.\nHe still needed to somehow find a way to get a gun."

Benjamin considered stealing the one at home, but it would be inconvenient for him once they found out that the gun was missing, which was why he gave up on that plan.\nWhat he needed was a gun that only he knew existed, and one that he could always carry around secretly.\nAfter some thoughts, Benjamin finally decided to buy one at the outskirts.\nHavenwright is the biggest city on the land, and the outskirts took up to 75% of its total land area. Although Havenwright was the main base for the church, the outskirts of Havenwright can be described as chaotic due to the church focusing its forces on pushing their influence outwards instead of maintaining order.\nBenjamin's knowledge on the outskirts did increase vicariously via the errands he sent Jeremy to complete. Once, Jeremy told him that there was a place where gunfire was sold and purchased, after returning from a trip to the outskirts. At least, Benjamin wouldn’t be heading there without a clue.\nHe was not afraid that the church might find out about this. Although the church's watch was not a tight one, Benjamin could never shake them off his tail — not especially if he wanted to buy a gun.\nThe bishop would then know that he went to buy a gun. So what?\nIn the eyes of the bishop he was only one terrified noble. After the events in the castle, it was normal for him to secretly buy a gun from the black market out of fear of the witch and also as an effort to protect himself.\nAs long as the church had no idea about the relationship between Benjamin and magic, they would never suspect a thing.\nAlso, under the watchful eyes of the church, he could not imagine that he would ever be in danger. No matter how dangerous the outskirts might be, he will be protected as long as he was not isolated from the outside world.\nAdditionally, the pendant from the church further increased his ability to protect himself. Although there was still some risk to this, what kind of teleporter was he if he did not even dare to take some risk? Furthermore, a gun was quite important to him.\nHowever as a precaution, he still planned to sneak into Claude's study and take the gun out of its hidden place.. He will return it after he got his own gun.\nAfter an afternoon of cultivation while lying on his bed, Benjamin's soreness faded into a slight discomfort. After dinner, he successfully stole the gun from the study, and sneaked out of the Lithur Manor under the cloak of the night.\nIn contrast to the inner city, the outskirts of Havenwright were still incredibly rambunctious in the night. Although there were yet to be electric lights in this world, a significant amount of people still walked around the place with oil lamps. Most of the shops were still open for business and had great customer flow with no signs of closing for the night.

With this inseparable bond between the nobles and the outskirts, it was even more difficult for the night to be in a serene and quiet one outside the city walls. The devoted followers who loved the peaceful nights usually would either become a priest and enter the inner city, or gather at the Blessed Zone in the outskirts. The Blessed Zone was an area where the church allocated for the people, and although it was full with residents, it was more silent than the inner city.\nAside from the Blessed Zone, there were no other functional areas in the outskirts. If zones such as entertainment zones and residential zones were to be drawn clearly, it would take a long time for the people to join recreational activities due to the large area of the outskirts. Thus, for convenience sake, everything except religion at the outskirts was mixed together.\nAt this moment, Benjamin was walking on the main roads of the outskirts. He observed the people who hurried around him as he carefully walked towards the place Jeremy mentioned.\nThe result of a convoluted geographical layout and population was a higher crime rate, which was especially prominent in the west side of the outskirts. Although the country invested much manpower and material resources into maintaining public order, it made no real change to the situation. However, if one ignore the culture of fierceness in the outskirts, the lives of the people were still relatively peaceful.\nBenjamin had quite a lot on him: his long-time savings from his pocket money, the cross from the bishop, and the pistol he stole from Claude’s study. If a pickpocket took any of these, he would have no idea where he could go and cry for their return. Hence, he needed to be extremely careful as a brat from the roadside could sneak up on him at any moment and steal his possessions without him knowing.\nJust as Benjamin was worrying himself about this, a child walked towards him from not far away.\nOh? Benjamin felt like an oracle, and he started imagining what might transpire:\n‘This son of a b*tch looked as squirmish as a rat, and not soon after, he would ‘accidentally’ knock into Benjamin, fall, and run as fast as the wind. Then, Benjamin would realise that he lost his valuables when he finally reacted and searched his pockets.

He finally got his money back. However, not long after, Benjamin was anxious once again. At the other bend of the alleyway, 3 weirdly dressed person walked out. They wore cloaks similar to Michelle’s. They did not have a hood to cover their face, however, which was why Benjamin was able to have a clear look at their faces. 3 of them were adult males, one elder, one tall, and one short, but all of them had the same eerie air around them.\nObviously, they heard the gunshot. Then, they looked strangely at the child lying on the floor before taking a glance at Benjamin. Then, they stopped moving.\nBenjamin had a premonition that something was wrong.\nIf he was not mistaken, those cloaks…. Those cloaks were very similar to Michelle’s cloak? The cloak for mages?\nOh, you gotta be kidding him. What were the odds to run into a few mages when he did nothing but run around in the kingdom? Sir bishop, the actions taken by the church to crack down mages are seriously lacking here!\nBenjamin did not feel happy when he knew that it was possible that they were mages, nor did he feel ecstatic for the prospect that he might be able to exchange some knowledge about magic with them. Instead, it was the opposite: Benjamin felt no goodwill from the three. His instincts shouted at him that they were not one of the good folks.\nMore importantly, Benjamin found out that he arrived at an unknown place after the chase. He was now standing in a dim and narrow back alley, the moon highlighting how deserted the place was. Not even a passerby could be found around him.\nWell, he went way overboard with this….\n\"This had nothing to do with you. This brat is a thief, and he stole my money. I just wanted my money back,\" Benjamin shouted at the three after some consideration. He wanted to avoid conflicts as much as he could.\nThe 3 people exchanged a look. Suddenly, the one who seemed to be the eldest of all spoke.\n\"He recognised who we are. We could never let them hinder our progress. Terminate them.\"\nBenjamin’s heart sank. Just as he jumped hurriedly from one thought to the next to find a way out, a voice was heard behind him, \"It’s the Fallen Ones! Hurry, don’t let them escape!\"\nClad in normal clothing and looking like a pair of husband and wife, two people rushed out from the opening of the alley behind Benjamin and ran straight towards the 3 people. Their agility shocked everyone in the vicinity, and Benjamin realised right after: these people are the watchers from the church! They were just in disguise!\nRight, why was he afraid? The people from the church was always with him!\nA detailed look at the ‘wife’ of the pair revealed that he was actually a man despite the wig and the dress. He threw the wig away with one hand, and the other went under his dress to draw out 2 swords. He tossed one of them to his ‘husband’, and with the other sword in hand, he hacked towards the three as he sped forwards on his high heels.\nBenjamin’s jaw dropped to the ground."

        "output": "You are amazing, my sister, oh wait, my brother?\nThe younger two among the three seemed to be shell shocked by this, and did not do anything other than opening their mouths in surprise. Only the eldest of the trio started to chant some spells as his expression changed.\nBenjamin felt a disturbance from the water particles. Next, a pale blue bubble enveloped the three of them.\n\"Water barrier!\" Benjamin recited in his heart.\nThe two disguised knights rushed towards the three, and without wasting any time, swords were swung, and they came into contact with the bubble. A burst of holy light shone on the swords, and the bubble vibrated intensely. Yet, the latter did not break. The bubble managed to hold on.\nAside from the knights, even Benjamin was surprised by that.\nSuch a strong water barrier!\nIf Benjamin was not mistaken, these 2 swords were Blessed before. Even though they were drawn from under a dress, they were still as sharp as before. It was indeed surprising that this thin water barrier could hold its ground against the 2 swords simultaneously.\nBenjamin could not help but wonder, when would his magic reach such a peak?\nOn the other side, the eldest mage scoffed after he saw his bubble successfully blocked the knight’s attacks. \"Only two holy knights. You might be able to save your own lives if you’ve worn the Armour of Holy Light, but since you’re not….\" He said as he tapped on the other two’s shoulders.\nThe two snapped back from their stupor after they heard his reminder. They each started to chant their spells and use their magic. Soon, a fireball and a wind blade was formed in each of their hands. Then, they were catapulted towards the 2 knights.\nThe knights did not lose their composure. As they faced the barrage of magic, their movements remain synchronized: a backward leap followed by a horizontal strike. As a result, the swords, glittering with holy light, cut through the fire ball and wind blade with ease. Seeing this, the eldest mage who was previously smiling smugly morphed his expression into one of anger.\n\"Are you daft? Why did you separate your attacks? Focus on one knight instead! They won’t be able to disperse 2 magic with 1 strike! What did you do with the techniques I taught you? Fed them to the dogs?\" The eldest mage’s outburst was not due to his surprise towards the skills of the knights. Instead, it was more likely to be caused by the idiotic actions of his 2 companions, and thus he could not help but to chide at them.\nThe knights pressed when he was speaking, and after they each swung their swords another time, they finally broke the bubble. Unfortunately, the eldest mage did not lower his guard as he was criticizing the two. At the moment before the knight could strike a second blow, he immediately patched a second water barrier. This successfully stopped the knights advancements as they remained outside of the water barrier.\nBenjamin was impressed. This person was great! Aside from his high levels of magic, he also had a lot of experience in combat, which caused him to look unworried even when there were two holy knights against him. The timing of when he cast the water barrier was basically flawless."

When Benjamin was still fascinated, the two young mages moved quicker than before. They immediately cast their spell, and a fireball and a wind blade once again appeared in their hands.\nInterestingly, they both chose the ‘wife’ to be their target. It was probably because ‘her’ outfit was too hard on the eye, and they wanted to get rid of it as soon as possible.\nNevertheless, the ‘wife’s’ movements were strangely agile, as with another backwards leap and horizontal strike, both the fireball and wind blade were no more. Taking this opportunity, the ‘husband’ of the pair maniacally launched an onslaught on the water bubble. \"...\" The eldest mage’s face was as dark as night.\n\"Which idiot would focus their attack like this? Didn’t you know how to attack from two different angles? If one of you attacked from the front while the other went for the back, would he be able to stop it with one swing of his sword? Oh, you are driving me nuts, what is this bullshit? Are you daft? Did I not teach you this? Before their sword could even touch me, I’ll probably be dead already, thanks to the anger you both gave me!\"\nThe two was dumbfounded by the scolding. The shorter one finally mumbled reluctantly, \"Teacher, how do we control the magic and attack from two different angles? We don’t know how to do that though.\"\n\".....\"\nThankfully, the knight broke the second bubble right on time, and it resolved the awkwardness in the air. The eldest mage was busy patching the water barrier with his spell, and thus was not so pissed off until he fainted from anger. Benjamin, who was the observer in the situation, vicariously felt mentally exhausted for the elderly mage.\nThis started as a great fight: a clash between two commendable forces, the mages and the holy knights. What even happened for the fight to deteriorate to this?\nNot only the eldest mage was in agony, the two knights were obviously not feeling ecstatic, too. When the bubble appeared in front of them for the third time, Benjamin saw the life draining away from their eyes as they were filled with hopelessness. Especially the one in a dress and heels, Benjamin seemed to have seen tears filling his eyes underneath the thick layer of eyeshadow.\nThe situation eventually came to a standstill. Every time the paladins broke through one of the water barriers, the elderly mage would conjure another as their longswords were completely unable to hurt the opponent. On the other hand, the opposition were almost the same, because the two younger mages were less intelligent, the three were not able to handle the paladin.\nBut Benjamin knew, this kind of standstill would not last for long.\nSeeing the way the elder mage fought, he knew he still had tricks up his sleeve. Right now he only wanted to show his apprentices, so he only used defensive magic. But once he unleashes the offensive spells, these two paladins probably would not be able to handle it anymore.\nIf they weren’t able to handle it, Benjamin would be in trouble too."

If he actually exposed his identity as a mage, he wasn’t certain if he would be allowed to live. This automatically threw away his rights to make decisions in this situation.\nPlus, he had yet to finish his preparations to betray the Church.\nBecause of this, he still chose to stand by the two paladin’s side.\nTherefore, he made his choice. He did not intend to continue idle by and do nothing ----- things have already developed to this phase, even though his magic has yet to mature, he had to join in and not continue to OB.\nIn his heart, a plan to break the stalemate formed quickly.\nAt that moment, the paladins launched a second wave of attacks at the water bubbles.\nRight when they slashed downwards with their swords, Benjamin moved. He rapidly raised his pistol, under the circumstances where no one noticed him, he opened fire at the elder mage without hesitation.\nBang!\nWith the sound of the water bubble popping and the gunfire mixed together, it gave everyone a shock.\nBenjamin, after firing the shot, rushed at the thief whose kneecaps were shot and unable to move. He did not care about what was going on with the mages and paladins after that shot, he only wanted to snatch back the money that was stolen from him.\nThe child did not resist, and Benjamin managed to get back the money after a while.\nAfter getting a hold of the money, Benjamin was relieved.\nThis was the plan he came up with: First of all, using his attack, it would be impossible to break the water barrier. Even though the paladins could break through it, they had to do a second slash to hurt the mage. But all the mage had to do was conjure another water barrier when they were doing their second slash, and it would block their attack.\nThis created an equilibrium, and Benjamin wanted to break this equilibrium.\nHe used the perspective of shooting to calculate the time, and shot the moment the water barrier broke. The bullet will go through the barrier the moment the water bubbles had an opening, and hit the intended target. The time taken for this to occur would be too short for the opponent to chant a spell, so there was no way to repair the barrier.\nA mage without a protective barrier was just like another ordinary human, as thin as a piece of paper in front of the bullet. Because of this, with just one shot, and there being no magic involved, it would definitely change the tide of the battle.\nHe took aim at the heart of the elder mage and fired, but because this was the first time he fired a gun with the intent to kill and he pitied the mage, his hand accidentally shook a little. Hence the bullet most probably did not hit accurately.\nEven though if it did not hit, he still managed to achieve half of his purpose.\nTo be honest, he never had the heart to kill his opponent.

Thus, no one would care about Benjamin, and he could continue his plan to buy a gun.\nEverything sounded good during the planning phase. The two paladins were protecting him, and Benjamin did not want them to get hurt, but the three opponents were mages just like him. When Benjamin recalled the few sentences at the end of the Bible, he hoped that they would not die here as described.\nRight when he thought of the plan, Benjamin could not help but laugh at himself. It was probably because he was like the main characters in the novels, making decisions on the whim, treating human life as something cheap.\nBecause of this, Benjamin fired the gun, snatched the money, and everything went according to plan. From the mages, there were terrible screams and shock, but there was no sound of someone falling to the ground. That confirmed that the bullet hit accurately without anybody dying. It was perfect. Benjamin immediately made his move to escape.\nBut, like every other plan he came up with before after he arrived in this world, no matter how perfect, there were still flaws.\nThe moment he was ready to escape, a few voices of angered chanting suddenly came from his back. The huge amount of magic and elemental power converging shocked him and he could not resist but turn around to take a look.\nHe saw a tsunami-like wave gathered in front of the three mages.\nDamn!\nWhat magic was this?\nBenjamin had predicted wrongly on how the elder mage would behave. It was probably after being angered by both his students and then getting shot, his anger reached the boiling point and triggered his berserk mode. Thus, he did not choose to use magic to escape, but instead, he chose magic to attack.\nSeeing this kind of power, conjuring a ten meter high wave in an alleyway was probably an ultimate level spell. This mage was already talented in using water barriers, how much more powerful would his signature moves be?\nFacing such a huge wave, Benjamin felt that he was not dealing with magic, but with the limitless Mother Nature herself, and felt as if there was no way to fight back.\nIs this…...Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique?\nFinally, a second before the wave came over him, he managed to make himself put up one last fight. By using a water ball spell to create a water bubble to wrap around him ---- he was not afraid of others figuring out that he was a mage. The two paladins who were standing in front were already devoured by the relentless water current. There were no other people around, no one knew that he used magic.\nA second after the water bubble formed, the huge wave came down on him.\nEverything in front of Benjamin became black and he lost all consciousness.\n\"Why are you chasing me?\"\n\"I need, sugar syrup!\""

Not knowing why, they brought you a long as well. The two paladins were abandoned back at the alley though.\"\nAfter hearing the System explain, Benjamin thought for awhile, then asked again: \"Where is this? How far away did they bring me?\"\nThe System replied: \"Don’t worry, we’re not out of the city, this is still in Havenwright. They didn’t go too far, probably about ten minutes. But this area is rather secluded and hidden, it would be hard for other people to come across here.\"\nOnly ten minutes?\nBenjamin was instantly relieved. What he was worried about the most was that he might have been brought to same distant place. Luckily, he was still in the outer area of the city. Based on the current time, he was probably not out for long.\nThe System could remember the way back, he wasn’t considered lost.\nAfter thinking of this, he stood up, under the instruction of the System, he was prepared to leave ---- since the two people already considered him to be knocked silly, right?\nHe has already seen enough trouble for tonight, he did not know if he should continue his journey to buy a gun.\n\"Hold up! You’re not allowed to leave!\"\nThe short one saw that Benjamin wanted to leave, panicked, and ran over to stop Benjamin.\n\"Why are you stopping me?\" Benjamin asked with no emotion.\n\"Even though we have no idea what magic you used to wound our teacher, seeing that our teacher is about to die, only you can save him now. Of course you’re not allowed to leave!\" The short one replied confidently."

        "output": "\"That’s right, you’re not allowed to leave.\" The tall one ran over as well to back him up.\nBenjamin was speechless. He did not use magic at all to wound the mage, he used a handgun, but was misunderstood by these two to be magic, it was humiliating. But, these two are probably dumb for thinking he had a way to save their teacher. What were they even thinking?\n\"Didn’t you say that I’ve already been knocked silly, how am I supposed to save someone in this state?\" Benjamin asked.\n\"Right, he’s been knocked silly, there’s no way he can save our teacher.\" Hearing this, the short one was stunned, his panicked state turned into a face full of sorrow.\n\"You’ve already lost your mind, it’s useless, you can go.\" The tall one shook his head, then said this to Benjamin.\n\"...\"\nNot knowing why, after being treated this way by the two, Benjamin somehow did not want to leave anymore.\nSeriously....\nWhatever.\nAfter some hesitation, he walked a few steps out, but let out a heavy sigh, and came back. He was rather helpless, faced the two and said: \"I haven’t lost my mind yet, where is your teacher, bring me to him, perhaps I can save him.\"\nHe felt like a teacher in a kindergarten, and a toddler fallen down, he could not resist but to help him get up.\nThese two \"toddlers\" heard this, looked at him, and displayed joyful expressions.\n\"You have to save our teacher, if not we’ll kill you.\" The short one dragged Benjamin and ran deep into the storage area, while happily saying these words.\nWhen Benjamin saw the short one walk over, and how he violently dragged the mage in the sack over. It made Benjamin think that if the elderly mage would realize what his students were doing, he would probably be angered till he came back to life right?\nBut he was not yet dead, and should not know what was going on.\n-----At least he was not dead yet.\n\"What bad luck did your teacher accumulate in his past generations that he’d end up having you two as students?\" Benjamin could not resist from exclaiming.\n\"Our teacher has said this before!\" The short one sounded very happy, but he didn’t seem to know what he was happy for, \"Our teacher would always say, if it wasn’t for our connection to the elements, being able to misread incantations but still somehow cast spells, he would never have accepted us two as students!\"\n\"...\"\nAfter hearing this, Benjamin felt conflicted, and could not give any further comments.\nHe should probably focus on saving people, right, focus on saving the mage.\nHe took a deep breath, and regained his focus, then looked at the wound on the elder mage’s chest.\nYeah....he can still be saved. The spot where the bullet hit was below the heart, blood was still flowing from it. Whether it was on purpose or not, Benjamin missed. The wound was not lethal, and it did not harm any organs. But if he continued to leave him in the sack, he would probably die from blood loss in another ten minutes.\nSeeing his pale complexion, he probably already lost a lot of blood.\n\"We don’t know any healing magic, are you able to save our teacher?\" The tall one asked."

But he had a healing water ball, and he has watched countless amount of TV dramas, so he had some arbitrary knowledge on how to extract the bullet.\nThere were no special tools around, thus he had to use his hands.\nFacing the bloodied wound, he was surprisingly calm. He tore open the clothing covering the wound and exposed the chest. He studied the wound carefully, then inserted his right thumb and index finger inside.\n\"What magic is this, it’s terrifying!\" The short one observed at the side, then started crying.\n\"Don’t cry, our teacher will not die.\" The tall one comforted him.\nBenjamin made an expression which spelled \"damned retards\".\nThe bullet was not lodged deep within, it was probably blocked by the rib cage, Benjamin could quickly feel the cold steel between the flesh. But because of Benjamin’s finger, the wound was widened, dyeing his whole hand red.\nSeeing this, Benjamin did not dawdle any further. After making sure his fingers held onto the bullet, he applied some strength and extracted the bullet. Success!\nThe whole process was rather successful, even though there was more blood loss, it was not life threatening.\nBenjamin could not help but feel as if he had the talent to become a doctor. If he knew of this earlier in life, he would have went in the medical field, that way he would still have skills he could use after teleporting, and not just some dumb speech drafts.\nAh, the regrets!\nAs he was occupied in deep thought of his untapped potential, he slowly placed the bullet aside. The two fools surrounded him, looking at the bullet curiously, as if they wanted to touch it but did not dare to touch it, only making shocked noises.\n\"This bullet was shot from a handgun, it’s a type of weapon, it has nothing to do with magic.\" Benjamin saw this and could not help but explain while shaking his head, \"What I am about to use though, is magic.\"\nFinishing his words, he started chanting, and conjured a water ball. He modified the elemental composition within the water ball, and made it so it had healing qualities, then he gently pressed the water ball against the mage’s wound.\nThe water ball slowly dissolved into the wound, the same wound that had been widened while extracting the bullet. As it dissolved further, the bleeding began to slow down.\nBenjamin expected this to happen: He was aware that one water ball was not enough to cover the wound. He guessed that even though it was the water of life, its healing qualities was not that great, if not all mages who knew this would be practically invincible.\nHe followed suit by making more of them, the healing water balls smashed against the wound one by one."

The mages were forced to bring their activity underground. The surviving mage clans banded together and exchanged spells and experiences. They helped each other escape from the Church, and this was the beginning of the Academy of Silence.\nAfter that, the Church started to strengthen its position and had its hold over the royal family, thus increasing their manpower to hunt mages. At that time, the most powerful mages founded the Academy of Silence for the sake of survival and to pass down magic. It was their dream to build a kingdom that was for mages.\nThe Academy of Silence was situated at the west side of the kingdom, surrounded by mountains. The terrain there was treacherous, and had few people living there. In addition, with the amount of magical beasts roaming there, it was hard for the Church to conduct searches. But the mages were able to use their magic to excavate and develop a kingdom there.\nThis continued on, and after a few years, the Church came to realize that there was a mage organization within the kingdom, but they were unable to find the source of it. Instead, the mages have found ways to create riots within the kingdom. At the same time, the threats from neighboring kingdoms has cost much of the Church’s manpower. Under these circumstances, the Academy of Silence strengthened its roots and continued to expand.\nAfter understanding this part, Benjamin suddenly thought of what the elder mage said: \"We can’t let these two stand in our way!\" These three probably have some ulterior motive in infiltrating the kingdom. Were they planning to incite another riot?\nHe asked these two about this question, but the two only answered:\n\"Our teacher said, this is a secret, we can’t tell anyone. Even if our teacher couldn’t remember it properly, we still couldn’t tell him!\"\nBenjamin thought for a while then said: \"You’ve forgotten, haven’t you?\"\nThe two nodded honestly, but then shook their head in guilt.\n\"....\"\nThus, Benjamin left without hesitation.\nOf course, before leaving, he did not forget to collect \"medical fees\" from these two. These two were easy to trick, Benjamin did not have to say much, and they already took out all the things they had. But Benjamin did not take everything they had, and only took two items based on their usability:\nA book called Getting Started with Magic, and a piece of rock that they called \"Water Element Crystal\"."

Was it that he did not realize his power had grown over time?\nBenjamin hadn’t had time to be happy about the thought before he realized the answer.\nHe took out the cross that was hanging in front of his chest, and properly examined it. The holy light that the cross emitted seemed to have dimmed, and it made Benjamin feel some pain.\nHe was not hurt by the huge wave not because of his water ball, but because of the activation of this tool.\nAccording to the bishop, this item could block three magical attacks."

Her leaving behind the gun would bring her more trouble in the future. It could be that she would die in one shot if she played her cards wrongly next time.\nWhy was she doing this? Other than being foolish there was no other purpose, or was she setting up another trap?\n\"Why? Why did she not take away the gun and the bullets?\nBenjamin’s train of thoughts was stuck once again.\n\"Did she not say? That was a sign of sincerity, you’re really terrible, treating other’s goodwill as something bad. \"At this moment, the System appeared, using a tone as if it had seen through everything to say this.\n\"...\" Benjamin was lazy to reply.\nIf it was really what the System said, then he still had something to look forward to!\nThis so-called trade was built on the fact that both of them were equal. But if Michelle still had to ability to take his life any moment, then they could not be considered equal, it would be an unfair trade.\nHe could help Michelle get what she wanted, but after that? If Michelle did not remove the seal and continued to threaten him with it, what would Benjamin do? Continue to be her servant? Might as well just die then.\nMaybe he could bank on Michelle’s humanity and trust that she would remove the seal after receiving the treasury. But in reality, it was too foolish and naïve to believe that."

He could finally catch some decent sleep after two of his worries was resolved.\nHe tucked himself below the blankets and as the darkness welcomed him.\nIt was a quiet night.\nThe next morning, he was awakened by the maid even though he still wanted to laze around in bed. After he hurried through his breakfast, he was then sent to the army base for ‘military training’.\nYeap, Claude did not withdraw his orders. He still needed to go to the base and train alongside the newbies. He nearly forgot about this after the eventful day.\nTo be honest, his schedule was a tad bit packed, even the popular artists would not have the workload he had yesterday. He nearly did not even have time to breathe!\nHowever, he was quite…... delighted?\nFor some reason, he felt as if some switch was turned on in him. Under all these complicated and twisted responsibilities, the side of him who was a workaholic was gradually forced awake.\nAlthough the life after the teleportation made him more exhausted, it also made him feel much more…...alive.\nAt this moment, he suddenly had an epiphany: If he was once again given the choice to teleport back to his original world, a place where he could once again get access to lights, air-conditioning and gaming consoles, or even an easy and high-paying job, he would probably find it difficult to fit in.\nThis world has changed him. He felt ambitious, even!\nLike last time, the soldier standing guard by the door quietly took him to the gunfire training grounds. Benjamin stared at the person covered with armor, silently curious whether he was the same cocky brat from yesterday.\nWell, he had no chance to verify his guess anyway as the soldier left without a word after he arrived at his destination.\nBenjamin could only turn around and enter the training grounds.\nA middle-aged man was leading the recruits into formation. When he saw Benjamin, he scoffed,\n\"Oh, you actually came? Since you’re here, get in line! Come earlier next time.\"\nBenjamin was dragged out of bed by his maid at 6 a.m. He did not get a good night sleep due to the events that happened yesterday night, so he was already exhausted enough. If he was required to arrive earlier for the next training, the man might as well just take his life."

All in all, he would not consider gingko unique and unusual.\nWhen he saw that the medium of his curse was a gingko, he was quite delighted. Fire spell, and a gingko? Would this mean that he could easily break Michelle’s curse?\nHowever, the System’s reminder made him understand the problem he was facing. If he could not find gingko in this world, what could he do? If there was no gingko to be found in Benjamin’s memories, it would probably mean that it could not be found in the kingdom. If Benjamin would stay in the kingdom, it would be almost impossible for him to find one.\nWhat if it was worse than that? What if the gingko in this world had already extinct?\nIt was understandable, actually. If Michelle chose a common leaf as the medium, she would be asking for for her curses to be broken. When he thought about it from this perspective, gingko was definitely a rare plant here.\nWhat could he do?\nAfter some consideration, he decided to do some research.\n\"Affirmative,\" the System gave him a positive answer.\nIf he was not mistaken, Grant was probably not in; he should be cultivating his divine arts in the church still. That was his routine throughout the weekdays.\nBenjamin found that the life of a genius and an average person was really different. An average noble of his age would have already ended their Sunday School curriculum and spend their days messing around and doing whatever they want. A genius, on the other hand, was still studying.\nGrant, though, Grant not only studied, he was wildly imaginative, and hid a lover around him.\nAs Benjamin recalled the episode when he ‘borrowed’ the book from Grant previously, he genuinely thought that he had the coolest baby brother.\nDid the bishop have any idea that Grant hid a person under his sheets? Benjamin reached Grant’s room in no time while he was lost in his thoughts. He knocked the door out of caution, and only opened the door as no one answered - Grant really did not have the habit of locking his bedroom.\nThere was no one in the room. Grant was yet to be home.\nBenjamin put aside his guilt and thought he was just going to borrow a book. It was nothing major. Hence, he marched straight to the study table, searched around for some time and finally found the book.\n\".\"\nBenjamin read these words on the book cover as he prayed fervently that he could find any clues on gingko in it.\n\"Grant?

The gingko leaf he randomly picked up to use as a bookmark was most probably in between one of the books.\nIf he accidentally fell asleep, it was possible that he came into contact with the books, which in turn caused the leaf to drop out of them…. \"...\"\nSo, this was all the fault of gingko leaves?\nBenjamin was overwhelmed by the unscientific approach of this explanation; gingko creating teleportation? You must be pulling his leg! However, worrying about science was not exactly a wise choice when he did successfully teleport himself into this world.\nThere was no use for him to cry over spilt milk. Whether the gingko could actually create teleportation no longer bore any meaning to Benjamin. What he needed to do now was to break the curse within him. Thus, he should instead focus on where he could find another leaf from the famed ‘Tree of Time’.\nIt was not stated in the book.\nGingko was a mythical item in the Kingdom of Helius; it was not even a popular myth but a neglected one. It would occasionally be mentioned in some obscure books or stories. No one had actually seen it before.\nThis was the reason why the descriptions about gingko in the Encyclopedia were rather brief.\nOh darn it... He would be dead meat.\nHow was he going to find something considered mythical?\nBenjamin’s attempt to break his curse met a dead end.\nMichelle was really something. Was it really necessary for her to find something so unusual to be the medium for her curse? She could have settled for some random piece of leaf! Instead, he was now left stuck in this mess.\n...Wait.\nHow did Michelle find gingko if it really was that scarce? A thought suddenly hit Benjamin as he barked at the System, \"Quick, show me the picture of the gingko leaf you just displayed. It’s Michelle’s leaf. Let me see it again.\"\nThe System sounded petulant, \"Why? That hogs up my RAM.\"\nBenjamin pressured the System, \"Stop dilly-dallying, hurry! Even if you stored up the bulk of your RAM, you wouldn’t even get a sprout anyways.\"\n\"Alright, alright, hold on,\" the System finally gave in after Benjamin’s constant urges. After thirty seconds of mechanical noises that came from the System’s processes, the picture was finally displayed before Benjamin.\n\"Zoom it, zoom it again...\"\nAs expected. When the picture was zoomed in and the details on the leaf were finally clear to Benjamin, he finally understood how Michelle found that gingko.\nThat was the bookmark he used before he teleported.\nFinally, the mystery was solved. He picked up the leaf and used it as a bookmark, and the bookmark somehow teleported him into this world and transformed him into Benjamin. The leaf was probably dropped right next to him, where Michelle picked it up and used it as a medium to curse Benjamin.\nSo, Michelle really did pick the gingko leaf at random and made it her medium to put a curse."

You gobbled up something this big, at least gurgle a little, please?\nJust when he felt like he was cheated, the triangular symbol suddenly vibrated and there came a ‘ding’ that was much clearer than it ever was before. A formless wave quietly swept through the whole Space, just like a ripple forming on the surface of a calm pond.\nIn his mind, tens of thousands of triangles were hit simultaneously, making the most wonderful ‘ding’ he had ever heard.\nThis…...\nAs he was still marveled by this out-of-body experience, the triangular symbol before him suddenly shone brightly in the darkness.\nThat was the third time he went into the mysterious world of blue. However, he did not see the blue symbol this time. The world was so blue as if it was being formatted, and weird noises echoed within the area.\nBenjamin listened attentively. The sound was repeating a specific word."

Its volume was bigger, too - it changed from a fist sized symbol to one that was bigger than a human head.\nThen, what about the Waterball Spell?\nHe chanted a Waterball Spell with high hopes. The water particles created a disturbance much like a tidal wave, and in a flash, a huge water ball was formed before him.\nA sphere, one that was taller than Benjamin himself.\nBenjamin was shocked. This water ball! He could swim in it!\nWas the Crystal that strong?\nAs he recovered from his surprise, he tried to compress the water ball.

It had become a water bomb!\nMost importantly, he could finish the process of materializing the water bomb in a very short time. Even though it was exhausting to compress the water ball, but he could still make six of these small water balls continuously. If he had the time to rest in between, he could make even more.\nEven if it was a holy knight who was physically strong and was wearing a blessed armor, he would probably pass out if he was hit by six of the water bombs.\nThe pacifist in Benjamin could not help but feeling the itch to try out his new ability.\nHe converted the water ball into a bubble and enveloped himself in it. He then punched the bubble. Damn, it hurt!\nBenjamin felt like he just punched a piece of bulletproof glass. The bubble did not move an inch. It did not shatter, no, it did not even tremble under the impact. This bubble was hard as if it made out of armored glass!\nAs he recalled the battle between the holy knights and the elder mage in the outskirts, Benjamin felt that even though his bubble was not as strong as the water barrier, it could probably withstand one strike from the blessed sword.\nCombining the attack and defense powers, he could already defeat one holy knight by himself. It would not even take much for him to do that.\nThe Water Elemental Crystal gave him a leap in his abilities!\nHe was reluctant to part with it at first, but now, everything was worth it!\nNot only the magical power in him, his elemental affinity also improved tremendously under the influence of the triangular symbol.

This training method sounded amazing!\nAfter an afternoon of meditation, Benjamin got his question answered. From his observation, he found out that although he was faster in his meditation, the ‘appetite’ of the symbol increased as well. Now, the symbol needed at least double the amount of water particles for it to grow. Benjamin’s progress did not improve, instead he seemed to have slowed down as time passed.\nAs expected, there could not be any hack to the process of learning magical.\nBenjamin’s fantasy where he could leap for the stars in no time was officially shattered.\nHe estimated that once his magical capabilities reached a certain level, the elemental requirement of the triangular symbol would increase tremendously although his productivity with meditating would improve. The Water Elemental Crystal would be of no use to him - the water particles would probably be less than what he could get if he meditated for an hour!\nHe knew it. It was impossible for something to be that effortless; or else if someone else got a bunch of Elemental Crystals and unlocked the space of their consciousness, they would become the most powerful mage in the world overnight!\nThe wisest way to do things was to just give constant effort and determination.\n…...Damn, he was turning into a ‘Chicken Soup for the Soul’ person.

Benjamin believed that Dean would start the actual shooting practice soon.\nHe was uninterested, though; with the shooting interface, there was no need for him to practice. However, once the shooting training started, it would be easy for Benjamin to take the opportunity to steal some bullets home. It would probably go under Dean’s radar as long as Benjamin behaved and only stole an insignificant amount.\nHe had no choice; Benjamin only owned 16 of the blessed bullets. He was very reluctant to use them.\nBenjamin took the time to read the Enchantments section that was mentioned in \"Magic 101\". Unfortunately, he could not find a suitable environment for him to train his enchanting skills.

Or was there someone behind this?\nIntentionally or unintentionally, Benjamin just wanted to know, who sent this person to kill him?\nAlthough this question had been forgotten for a long time, who knew if it would suddenly come out at a crucial moment again to deal Benjamin with fatal blow? Now that he finally had an opportunity to find the answer, he naturally would not let go of it.\nSo after the paladin was shot dead, Benjamin did not do anything. The reason was simple: The paladin that the Church sent to protect him was dead, which meant he was now free to use magic. Since he could use magic, should he even fear of this bandit leader?\nWhy not just tag along, maybe he could get a chance to question that assassin.\nTruth be told, that knife-scarred man would not harm him anyway -- that knife-scarred man still had questions for him!\nIt seemed like the situation had returned to when he was with Michelle. Since he was of value to Michelle, she did not kill him. He was the same to the knife-scarred man, so he would not kill him.\nThis was Benjamin's second kidnapping, he was experienced in this.\nHe did not think he made the same mistake the paladin did by underestimating the enemy. He looked at the knife-scarred man very carefully. In fact, this man was not as ferocious as he looked. On the contrary, the man was very cunning.\nHe was acting dumb from the beginning. Even if the paladin was quite cautious, he was still not careful enough and showed his weak spots."

The newly condensed runes were also quickly absorbing the water elements. Finally, last night, following a \"ding\" sound, the task was completed.\nBenjamin turned back to look, and in the darkness, the water ball shone brilliantly. The light was equivalent to the light that split the darkness when he excavated his new dimension of consciousness.\nHe had a feeling that he was blessed. After he walked to the side of the water ball, he reached out his hand towards the water ball while chanting the Icebreaking spell’s incantation -- between Icebreaking and the Pillar of Steam, he chose Icebreaking. Ice was a solid object and had offensive capabilities. At the same time, the coldness that came with it was also good for controlling, so it was much more useful than the gaseous form of water.\nAt the moment he said the incantation, the shining water ball froze rapidly, as if it turned into a bright crystal ball.\nThen, cracks formed on the ice ball.\nVery quickly, following the cracks on the outside, more formed within, as if something was happening in the center of the ice ball. It started shaking as its light grew more intense. \"It’s coming!\" Benjamin said with strong anticipation.\nFinally, the ice ball shattered, the light died out, and a blue triangular rune that looked that same appeared.\nOnce the triangle was formed, it started trembling, making a \"ding\" sound of its own.\nRipples swept through the whole dimension of consciousness. Benjamin felt like something has changed once again.\nEven though he regretted not being able to enter that pure blue space again, he also quickly moved on from his joy at successfully condensing a new rune to begin testing his new spell – Icebreaking.\nOf course, through his experimentation, he found even more surprises.\nHe found that his new rune did not need further strengthening, it was as powerful as the previous one. Under its influence, Benjamin could conjure a giant block of ice with the Icebreaking spell and he could control it freely.\nHe could break the ice into arrows, or he could condense it to farm a sturdy shield... he seemed to have become the world’s best ice sculptor, and could manipulate the ice and turn it into whatever he wanted.\nOf course, the time needed for the ice to change form would be longer compared to the Water Ball.\nBut Benjamin was not discouraged, as he found out that the limitations for the compression of ice was beyond water. He could change his washing machine sized ice block into just a needle.\nA needle which with one look was enough to freeze your heart.\nThis needle replaced the blessed bullets, and become his newest killing tool. He believed, even with that elderly mage’s water sheet, once his needle pokes it, it would freeze over and break apart."

The moment the knife scarred-man was about to pull out his gun, he stabbed his shoulder.\nIn this moment, he was not sure how strong the ice needle was, what if it could not control the man? Therefore he used all his might to jab it in. Luckily, its strength was far more than Benjamin expected it to be.\nThe knife-scarred man still held onto his collar, but could no longer move. His face was coated in frost, his eyebrows had ice and his whole body was emanating a white mist, he could not even twitch. Benjamin felt like he was facing an ice sculpture.\nWith just his jab, did he die from freezing?\n\"My God, so powerful!\" Even the System emerged and exclaimed.\nAfter some thought, Benjamin quickly pulled out the ice needle to disperse the magic, the frost in the man’s body also dispersed.\nHe did not want the knife-scarred to man die just like his, he still had questions.\nLuckily, the knife-scarred man did not really die. When the magic was gone, the knife-scarred man was still frozen for a while, but he suddenly let go of his grip on Benjamin’s hand. He fell to the ground and started coughing furiously, coughing out some blood colored ice. His whole body was quivering, as if he was just rescued from the South Pole, which filled Benjamin with sympathy.\n\"I…...I....\" He made some sounds which did not form into a sentence.\nSeeing this, Benjamin took back his gun, and started chanting, conjuring a healing water ball, which he used on the knife scarred man.\n\"I…...Thank…...Thank you.\"\nThe knife-scarred man’s condition improved, and he could finally talk.

He had escaped from the previous ambush and he… he turned out to be an evil mage.\"\nEven though this idea was formed in a rush, he could not show any sign of guilt as he had already opened his mouth.\nLife is like a play, everything depends on his acting skills!\nThe leader of the cleaners heard him out and furrowed his eyebrows as he looked at the corpse and then revealed a shocked expression. It looked like they had already heard of rumors regarding the bandits of Mount North. The leader exchanged a look with the other cleaners.\n\"Lord Lithur, please calm down. Can you kindly tell me what happened here?\" He looked at Benjamin and asked.\nBenjamin took a deep breath as if he was trying to calm himself down but in reality he was trying to create a fake story.\nAt that moment, he felt like he was like the poet CaoZhi creating the ultimate poetry, churning his brain and acting with his limbs at the same time.

Never in my mind would I expect her to send a bandit to abduct me!\"\nThe cleaners exchanged glances among each other when they finished listening to his story.\nBenjamin could feel that their suspicion had subsided as they were exchanging their glances.\nBy the looks of it, the fake story made up by Benjamin was not half bad. He even managed to relate Michelle to the story plot, hence making the story even more realistic.\nThe stiffness of his hands due to nervousness finally faded as he finished his story.\n\"Lord Lithur, did you kill this fallen one?\" The leader of the cleaners questioned again.\nBenjamin nodded and answered: \"He was very delighted when he killed the Holy Knight and he did not realise I have a gun with me. As I have been training with the King’s army in the regiment for the past few days, I took out my gun when he turned his back against me. However, he was alerted by it and immediately turned towards me. I triggered the gun and… and he has been lying there since then. I was afraid that the gunshot would attract his underling here so I planned to leave this place immediately with Jeremy. Then you guys arrived the moment I picked Jeremy up.\"\nTo turn against the tide and kill the knife-scarred man might sound a little too dramatic for this story. Benjamin could only describe the events in more details to ensure that his story was as realistic as possible.\nHowever, how much detail could he describe within this short amount of time?\nHe had no confidence in himself at all by the time he finished his make-believe story. He did not know if this story could convince the cleaners or the church.\n\"I see.\" said the cleaner while nodding his head. The hostility between the cleaners and Benjamin had finally subsided. The cleaner continued: \"Lord Lithur, we can not simply make decisions on our own for this incident as it involves the death of a holy knight and a fallen one.

Time would not stop if he hesitated to think about these questions.\nThere was nothing much to consider as if he would live another day if he were to give his all and die if he did not.\nThey needed to wipe out all the Cleaners so that all this incident would be buried in this dirty sewer.\nIt was also due to this reason that Michelle reminded him via her gaze to destroy the God’s eye as he was killing the Cleaners’ leader."

He expected the remaining ten Cleaners to gang up on him and so it was necessary to be prepared.\nIt was a known fact that a Cleaners’ mission was to wipe out mages. Although Michelle \"betrayed\" them, she did not use any spells at all.

Hence he summoned the Icebreaking Spell in hope to use the laws of reflection of light to counter the swords of holy light.\nThis strategy was not something he came up with in the midst of the crisis. He was already finding ways to counter divine art when he was learning Icebreaking Spell since he had to face the Church in the future.

This was a \"fake chance\", and he fell for it, other than the pain from the curse, he would not get hurt in any other way. Michelle would still appear, if it would not be this time, maybe next time.

No scent of alcohol could be traced as it must be because the storage had been abandoned too long.\nBenjamin used one of the wine barrels as a chair. He sat on top of it and waited for Michelle.\nAfter leaving the house in the sewers, Michelle hid Benjamin in the abandoned storage. She wanted Benjamin to wait here, while she went back to the Church to observe the situation.\nBenjamin wanted to ask Michelle, how she managed to turn into a mage after becoming a holy knight. But Michelle only gave a look that appeared to say \"Let’s not talk about the past\", and reverted to the topic about the Church, and was adamant that she had to go back.\nAccording to Michelle, the Church would create a cross that represented each knight. The cross would be filled with divine energy, if a knight died, the cross would automatically shatter, informing the Church of the knight’s deceased status.\nAfter hearing of this, Benjamin thought that he had teleported into some sort of immortality cultivating novel.\nBut after giving some thoughts, magic tools like these were really useful and required in managing the tens of thousands of knights. It was understandable for the Church to do so and Benjamin found no meaning to make fun of it.\nIt was because that knight that was killed by the knife scarred man and had his cross shattered which alerted the Church. That was why they sent the squad of Cleaners.\nIf the knights had such a system like this, then the Cleaners should be no different. The Church already knew something had happened since the death of the first Cleaner.\nRight now fourteen crosses had been shattered. Benjamin would not dare to imagine what the bishop’s face would look like.\nThe Church would take extreme measures for sure.\nThus, after taking Benjamin to the storage, Michelle had to return to the Church to observe the situation in the inner ranks of the Church. Benjamin had to know what the Church was up to right now, only then he could forge a story that would be convincing to the Church.\nMichelle made her way to the Church. Before she left, she said she should be back in two hours, thus, Benjamin waited patiently.\nHe wanted to make use of this time to meditate, but two hours would be too short, and meditating for this short would not make much progress. Most importantly, after entering his own realm of consciousness, Benjamin’s sensitivity to the outer world would be reduced.

To find out what was going on inside the city, he had to find out from the lips of nobles like Dick.\nIf only he could go back into the city now, things would be so much easier; but with how he looked now, how could he even step foot into the city?! Should someone recognize him, he wouldn’t be able to explain himself at all!\nHence, he stopped his departing steps and turned around instead, towards to theatre once more. He slouched, trying his best to look as much like a beggar as possible so he could eavesdrop in Dick’s conversation with his workers.\nAfter what seemed like a bunch of bullsh*t and gossip about the theatre and performances, Benjamin heard this,\n\"Master, has something happened inside the city?\"\nIt seemed the situation in the inner city was a matter of interest to everyone. It didn’t even take long for someone to ask a question like this.\nDick answered very casually, he had no reservations as he spoke frankly,\"I’m not sure, I don’t even know what the hell the church is up to. I’m guessing that those followers of The Fallen One must have something to do with it. I even heard from someone that the entire kingdom’s holy knights have been summoned to somewhere on standby. Everywhere in the kingdom people are being moved for some big operation.\"\nHearing this, Benjamin couldn’t help but shiver a bit in fear.\nThe church is consolidating their power.\nWhat do they plan to do?\nWhile he was afraid that this sudden consolidation of power might be because of him and Michelle, upon giving it more thought, Benjamin realized that just the two of them couldn’t possibly rock the church like this.\nCompiling what Michelle said earlier about how she gave the Academy of Silence’s address to the church, Benjamin quickly affirmed his latter thought.\nUnless...the church plans to declare war on the academy of silence?\nAlthough this was an unbiased guess, Benjamin felt that it made a lot of sense. The church is already mobilizing its armies, if not for war, what else?\nNot just that, Michelle’s late appearance could also be explained now—she must’ve been summoned by the holy knights. She must probably be stuck in the battalions now, unable to excuse herself. Upon coming to this conclusion, Benjamin sighed a breathe of relief.\nIf everything was truly the way as he thought it to be, then him and Michelle’s plan could be considered to have succeeded. The church probably believes that the Academy of Silence killed the Cleaners, this would clear Benjamin of any suspicion and nobody would suspect him of being a mage then.\nWhile he had no idea how Michelle did it, but the fact that she did, Benjamin was pretty happy.\nHowever...\nIf the church really believes that the Academy of Silence killed the Cleaners, then they must also believe that the Academy kidnapped Benjamin. Now, how will Benjamin return to the Lither family then?"

Since he had already heard what he needed to hear, he ought to stay away from Dick just in case of getting made. Plus, Dick probably didn’t know much, so there was little to no reason to stick around.\nAs he walked away, he quickly stepped into an alley by the side of the street.\n\"How’re the false memories coming along?\" he asked the System.\n\"False memory construction complete, saving memories now...\"\nBenjamin cut the System before it could finish the sentence,\"alright, you can stop for now.

Suddenly, a teenager in ragged clothes walked up to him with his hands on his waist, sternly blocking the way. Benjamin was stunned at sight of this.\nAt the same time, another beggar-like teen walked up to him from the back, blocking his path of retreat.\n\"These two look like they’re on the same team,\" the System popped out of nowhere again, trying to sound wise like it had just made a profound statement.\n\"Are you even done with the false memories yet?!

Hence, when the person in charge of the theater came looking for a beggar, they assumed that it was him. Thus, that previous scene happened.\nBenjamin was dumbfounded by this turn of events. How should he consider this? He was not actually unlucky per se; just baffled by this.

There was also a person wearing a wig that looked like his head was stabbed with a knife. His was holding a blood-stained violin.\nThis was an unusually rowdy place. The managers, actors, prop-makers, makeup artist, musicians…... The number of people that flocked together were uncountable, and Benjamin could not discern what they were discussing. In short, the atmosphere backstage was tense like a warzone before the performance.\nBenjamin was grateful for this.\nIf he felt something was up, it was convenient for him to quietly leave this unruly place. He would not have to worry about fleeing.\nHowever, it would be difficult for Benjamin to find the owner for the piece of cloak amidst the crowd.\nHe grossly estimated around one hundred people here in the backstage, and it would be problematic to find one out of the one hundred.\n\"Here, this is Mr Henry, and you’ll just need to cooperate with him,\" Suits led Benjamin to the youth in the top hat.\nMr Henry looked like a pretentious magician. He nodded at Suits, without uttering a word.\nBenjamin did not react as well. He was too preoccupied observing the people around him.\nHenry the magician drew his brows together.\n\"Will this be okay? It is indeed realistic to get a real beggar to play the role, but wouldn’t it be too realistic? This child does not have the required abilities to help with my performance. A professional actor would be a better choice.\"\nSuits smiled tightly, \"Mr Henry, we are left with no choice. You needed a mere beggar, but the actors in the kingdom are all big wheels in the industry. Who would be willing to play a pitiful beggar? You don’t even know how bad of an attitude the actors have; they are not like any actor you can pick from the crowd in the circus. Please bear with it, Mr Henry.\"\nDispleased, Henry snorted and grumbled something along the line of \"Might as well get someone from the circus,\" but he did not make any further requests.\nHowever at the same time, Benjamin who appeared to be in the clouds felt an abrupt disturbance from the elements.\nOh?\nHis heart leaped. He never expected to find a clue that easily.\nA disturbance from the elements must be caused by a mage.\nStill, how would Benjamin be sure if the person is a mage?\nBenjamin had a sudden idea and he decided to widen his senses to detect the elements. Without anyone noticing, he started to use his Water Particle Detection to feel his surroundings.\nThe nature of magic was the communication between elements, thus surrounding elements of a mage would always be unique."

Did he see this wrongly?\nTo make sure that his senses were not screwing up, he retraced his Water Particle Detection before spreading it out once again, attempting to sense the disturbances of water particles backstage.\nThe result was the same.\nBenjamin inhaled sharply.\nThis was a winning lottery ticket!\nHe imagined that mages would hide in the theater, but he never expected the theater to be the mages’ hideout cache!\nThe Fulners were... really something!\nBenjamin knew that some nobles would secretly sponsor several mages within their manors. But to sponsor them within the kingdom, gathering all forty of them together, and using them all to hold a performance? The Fulners must have balls bigger than the tall mountains to do this!\nBenjamin was in severe deep shock.\nSuits and Henry ended their conversation when Benjamin was still in a daze.

        "input": "他在水元素感应的状态下，又把目光放回了自己身上。出乎意料的是，通过元素的感应，本杰明却现，自己周围的水元素并没有任何异常。\n有意思了。 是因为意识空间吗？他和其他法师走的路子完全不同，所以产生了这种区别。\n仔细想了想，本杰明很快明白了个中道理。\n普通的法师练习魔法，是不断锤炼自己的精神力和元素亲和力。而当元素亲和力得到强化之后，他们周围的元素自然而然会生一些变化。 不仅如此，他们在施展魔法的时候，利用的也是周围的元素，因此，这一现象也是他们为了施展魔法而做好的准备。\n本杰明则不一样。他的元素亲和力不好，靠的都是魔法字符，因此周围的元素不会受到影响。而他施展魔法靠的也是意识空间里储存的水元素，跟现实无关。 确实……是很有趣的差异。\n如此想来，用意识空间去学习魔法，能够把一个魔法的威力无限放大，恐怕也是因为这个缘故。 现实中的元素就算再密集，也不可能过某一个程度。因此，依靠现实中的元素施法，一般法师的魔法威力都是有极限的。而意识空间里，只要魔法字符够强，元素再密集都没关系，所以凭借意识空间去施法，威力没有极限。\n原来如此。\n想明白了这些，本杰明感觉，自己对魔法的认知都变得清晰了一点。\n因此，尽管躲在伸手不见五指的箱子里，他的心情还是很高兴。\n他脑子秀逗了吗？为什么就这么乖乖地躲进了箱子里？\n开玩笑，他可不能真的上台表演。而既然都准备要逃走了，那他在这里配合度这么高是要干嘛？\n刚刚一直处于现法师聚集地的震惊之中，他各种走神，都忘了这一茬了。\n他已经现了剧场的法师，再留在这里，对他而言也没什么意义。他也没打算突然从箱子里跳出来，抱着亨利大喊道：“老乡啊，我也是法师。”然后全后台三十多个法师抱在一起大哭。\n最初支撑他作死的好奇心动力也渐渐消失了。\n那他还待这干嘛呢？\n赶紧溜啊！\n本杰明开始计划他如何从剧场溜走。\n他先用水元素感应法，感应了一下箱子外的情况。亨利还站在箱子边，跟另一个看上去是魔术师但实际是法师的人面对面，讨论得热火朝天。\n好吧，暂时是没办法从箱子里出来了，还是等亨利走远一点再说吧。",
        "output": "Under the Water Particle Detection, he focused on himself instead of the others. Unexpectedly, the water particles around him did not experience any disturbances.\nThis…. This is interesting. Was it because of the space of his consciousness? Was it because of the difference in training that caused this contrast?\nBenjamin wondered, and soon he realised the theory behind it.\nThe ordinary joe who trained their magic used the method of raising their spiritual power and affinity to the elements. When their affinity level increased, it was normal for the elements around them to change as well. Not only that, they utilized the elements around them when they cast spells. Thus, the phenomenon of elements orbiting around them was also a way for them to prepare themselves before casting magic.\nBenjamin was a whole different story. His affinity to the elements was weak, and he could only rely on the triangular rune. Therefore the elements surrounding him would not be affected. Also, when he cast a spell, he relied on the stored water particles in his Space. His spells were not derived from the real world.\nThis could also explain why the power of a spell is limitless if the mage learnt magic with the space of his consciousness. The concentration of elements in reality would also be limited; no matter how dense they were, they would always have a cap. Thus, if a mage relied on the elements available to him in reality, his power would also be capped. On the other hand, the concentration of elements in the Space was not an issue as long as the triangular rune was strong enough. Hence, there was no limits to how powerful a spell could be when the mage used his Space.\nThis seemed to be it.\nBenjamin’s understanding towards magic became clearer after this round of brainstorming.\nEven though he was trapped in a dark box, he was still delighted. Eh, wait.\nWhat was wrong with his brain? Why would he obediently get into the box as instructed?\nThere was no way he was going to perform on stage later, and since he was planning to escape, why would he be cooperating with the magician?\nHe was probably too distracted by the gathering of the mages that he totally forgot about escaping.\nThere was no point for him to stay since he had identified the mages in the theater. He did not intend to leap out of the box, enthusiastically take Henry into an embrace and shout, \"Oh, my lad, I’m a mage too!\", which could lead the thirty over mages backstage to break into a group hug and sob dramatically. No. Definitely not that.\nThe initial curiosity died down too.\nSo what was he still doing here?\nHe should flee!\nBenjamin immediately started plotting his escape from the theater.\nHe first used Water Particle Detection to have a sense of the situation outside the box. Henry was standing outside the box, and he was having an intense discussion while facing another mage who looked like a magician.\nWell, he could not get out of the box. All he could do was to wait for Henry to leave the vicinity."

He might as well be patient and wait for the perfect opportunity.\nAlso, Dick!\nHow could Benjamin forget about him.\nSuddenly, Benjamin was hit with an epiphany. Something was off.\nHow was it possible for Dick to be oblivious about this? This was Fulners’ new theater, and the mages were most probably gathered by the Fulners. Benjamin would never believe that the Fulners’ intention was innocent; why would they gather all the mages at a place and start a much-anticipated premier in this theater?\nWhat were they conspiring?\nIf it really was just for a show, was such a magnificent lineup really necessary?\nBenjamin was suddenly reminded by the proverb, ‘Coming event cast their shadows before them’. He broke into a new territory without any preparation. No matter what happened tonight, it would be a startling ‘premier’ from the Fulners because they put in so much effort for the preparation.\nThe hierarchy of the nobles in the kingdom was as follows: The Lithurs, affiliated with the Church, had the highest status; the Fulners, though had the same ground with the Lithurs due to their their business and commercial achievements, was always suppressed by the Church.\nWould it be that the Fulners were fed up with the situation they were in? Were they preparing to join forces with the mages?\nJust when Benjamin was filed with myriad of thoughts, three crisp bangs were heard which pulled him back into reality - someone knocked on the box three times.\nBenjamin was bewildered because he was interrupted from his thoughts.\nHad the performance started already? Although he was puzzled, he still walked out of the box just as Henry told him to.\n\"Yes! That’s it! That’s the feeling that I want!\" Benjamin stood at the side of the box, his face lit with surprise, \"That was great! When you are on stage, do this exact expression when you get out from the box. Then, leave the stage from the door to your right. Your mission will be completed then.\"\nBenjamin was speechless. So this was a rehearsal, huh.\nThat was a random rehearsal; something that was done because Henry felt like it. Was this the rumored free-spirited enthusiasm of an artist?\n\"Great, let’s do a rehearsal again!\" Without considering Benjamin’s feelings, Henry excitedly exclaimed as if he was touched by Benjamin’s performance.\nBenjamin doubted Henry’s identity as a mage.\nBenjamin could not help but suspected Henry’s true identity.\nIt was probably because he could never understand the appreciation between a magician and his actor.\nThus, Benjamin had no choice but to rehearse under Henry’s commands.

If they knew each other’s true identity as mages, their tone of voice, body movements, and expressions would have minute changes, no matter how hard they attempted to hide them. However, judging from the existing situation, all the mages probably assumed that they were the only mage here, and were trying to hide their identity.\nWhy would it be so? Did the Fulners really just wanted to stage a show, and thus did not reveal the identities of the mages? Were the Fulners unaware of their identity, and only found a bunch of performers who coincidentally were all mages?\nBenjamin pondered. A bunch of oblivious mages happened to have gathered together under these circumstances....\nBenjamin suddenly remembered the piece of information he got when he was eavesdropping on Dick before.

His eyes were wide like a deer in the headlights, his steps comical like a sneaky thief. As he wobbily stepped to the centre stage, the music stopped abruptly. The audience stared at Henry, their eyes full of anticipation.\nHenry stood still in the centre stage. He suddenly flipped out the empty pockets in his pants, and made an exaggerated face of sadness to the crowd.\nSome of the audiences were entertained as they chuckled.\n\"To combine comedy and magic is one clever way of performing,\" Dick commented somberly like a judge, as if the chamber pot in his hand was the trophy for the champion, \"We shall see. The major component for his performance will still be his magic.\"\nNo one was listening to him, though.\nSoon, the laughter died down. Suddenly, a blonde woman clad in a short skirt came on stage.\nHer arrival caused a small commotion in the crowd. She did not interact with the audience, though. Instead, she walked straight towards Henry and scowled at him, her hands on her face, and her face puffed up in anger. She looked half furious as she pouted prettily.\nThe audience were amused.\nHenry looked helpless as he scratched his head, as if he had no idea how to handle the situation.\nAs he scratched and scratched, a rose suddenly emerged from his hair.\nHis face was suddenly lit with realisation as he grinned cheekily at the lady, knelt down on one knee, and gave her the flower.\nLaughter and applause rose from the audience.\nDick saw this, nodded and commented with an air of superiority, \"Although this kind of performance would not be suitable for the inner city, it still has its worth in the outskirts.\"\nCante stupidly clapped along with the crowd, and he did not stop chortling even after everyone stopped. No one had any idea what he was so happy about.\nDick rolled his eyes at Cante and his face was filled with disgust as he pretended to not know Cante - at that moment, he had the urge to switch places with someone else!\nThis idiot was going to shame the Fulners!\nDick facepalmed as he hid himself from the crowd. However, he suddenly heard startled shouts.\nOh? Did the magician show more tricks?\nDick was confused.\nThis was bad performance timing - most of the audience were still caught up in the comedic effects of the last joke, it was too hurried if a new trick was displayed now.\nDick frowned, lifted his head and looked at the stage.\nThe stage was empty.

The bloody swords were evidence that they had just taken away some lives.\nThe jovial music screeched to a halt.\nBefore the band could react, a few priests stood up from the audience.

He was also the original planner for tonight’s performance.\nWith a confident stride, he walked in and said, \"Also, please cooperate with the will of God and refrain from leaving the theater without permission. Or else, you will be assumed to be the follower of the Devils, and you will face the Holy Lights as your retribution.

In an effort to curb the rampant evil forces, the church and Duke Accius Fulner plotted a trap for the mages.\nFirstly, Duke Accius contacted an unknown mage organisation and worked to gain their trust. Then, he used the name of the Fulners and the organisation to recruit any mages hiding in the kingdom.\nFinally, on the fated night, the Fulners used the performance as an excuse to gather the mages, and the church deployed the battalion of Holy Knights to capture them, once and for all.\nAs mages were skilled in the art of disguise, the Church decided to be cautious and kill everyone -- even if they got an innocent person -- just to ensure that no mage was accidentally released. It assumed all the staff in the theater were mages and annihilated every single one of them. Of course, they would never include this detail in the statement.\nWhat else was written on the notice board, then? It was of course the numerous ‘crimes’ committed by the mages: Colluding with the devil, harming the public, spreading evil… At the end of the notice, another crime was added: Kidnapping the nobles.\nIt wrote: \"Benjamin Lithur, son of Duke Claude Lithur, was found backstage and in a box. His head was injured, and he was unconscious and clad in tattered clothing when the Holy Knights rescued him and rushed him back to the church. The church confirmed that Benjamin Lithur was kidnapped, tortured and knocked out by these mages before he was brought backstage.

Of course, some would also imagine that this was an act of revenge from the Fulners to the Lithurs, and come up with some conspiracy theories.\nHowever, in the inner city...\nAs the character described in the excerpt, Benjamin kept rereading the text.\nAt this moment, Benjamin was reclined on his bed in his bedroom, lazily reading the copy of the statement that Jeremy got for him. He was deep in thought.\nYes, he was back in the Lithur Manor.\nIn fact, Jeremy was also rescued by the people from the church.

That was why he rammed his head on the box and knocked himself out.\nEverything else happened just as he expected after that. The Holy Knights appeared and slaughtered everyone; no one survived it, regardless if they were mages or ordinary people. Benjamin escaped the onslaught by hiding in the box, and when the Church searched the theater after the initial killing, they found an unconscious Benjamin.\nThey then brought Benjamin back to the church where the bishop recognised him. Everyone who saw Benjamin died in the theater, and the church had an agreement to not interrogate Dick. The bishop then read the forged memory. With that, Benjamin was confirmed to be innocent, and he safely returned to the Lithurs.\nThe process was indeed extremely perilous.\nBenjamin was grateful that he managed to figure out the Church’s trap just in time for him to react effectively. If he did not think and instead escaped the backstage, he would be stopped by the Holy Knights in ambush. If that really happened, he probably would already be dead by now.\nHe was basically walking on a tightrope!\nAfter he was filled with thankfulness, he was soon filled with grief.\nThere were nearly a hundred people backstage, 30 of them were mages. Only he survived. Although he did not know them, he still felt sad for his fellow mages.\nHe could now understand the reasoning behind Michelle’s determination to overthrow the Church and to build a country for the mages.\nEvery mage in the kingdom was fatally impacted by this raid.

Since they returned to the Lithurs, Jeremy became much more fearful than before. He would not even look at Benjamin in the eyes, and he looked guilty all the time. Before this, he resembled a skittish rat; now his mannerisms made a turn for the worse. He would shudder in fear if you speak to him in a slightly louder voice.\nIt seemed that his servant was really affected by the deception he experienced.\nBut to be fair, the whole incident started when Jeremy was tricked by the scarred man and went into the bar. It was understandable for Jeremy to blame himself, but all this was in the past, and there was no point for Benjamin to be angry at his servant.\nBesides, he did get something out of this incident."

He really needed to look for an opportunity to retrieve them.\nHm... Maybe he should let Jeremy do that some other day. Benjamin was not impatient about it either. The things were buried at a remote place, so no one would find it anyway.\nAs Benjamin thought about this, he stepped out of his room and walked towards the living room.\nAs a noble household, the Lithurs are required to eat dinner together daily. Although his original personality would prefer to take dinner back to his room and eat in solitude, he got used to eating with the others after the time he spent here.\nSoon, he arrived in the living room and sat in his seat.\nEvery Lithur was present: Claude, Mary, Grant, and the madame. Everyone was sitting primly in their seats as they waited for dinner to start.\nBecause he recently survived a kidnapping, they looked at Benjamin a little differently.\nBenjamin did not mind the attention. As long as Claude did not scream at him or arrange anything weird for him, he was happy.\nAfter some small talk and questions about their wellbeing, the servants started serving dinner. Claude and Mary chatted continuously throughout the meal, with Mary asking Grant about his studies in between bites. She also showed concern towards Benjamin’s experience. The madame only spoke occasionally as she spoke sarcastically towards Mary with an innocent face.\nIt was an ordinary dinner. Benjamin ate, his heart and mind elsewhere; he was busy pondering the truth behind the incident in the theater.\nThere was still one detail that he could not explain.\nIf Accius was forced to betray his mages, who then was the whistleblower who wanted to back Accius into the corner? Was it Michelle?\nIt was possible.\nIt was also a tactic to shift the blame for the Cleaners’ death to the mages in the theater. Since the mages were related to the Silent Academy, and Michelle did intend for the church and the Academy to go to war, she would be more than willing to be the whistleblower.\nOnce again, Benjamin felt that Michelle indeed is a person full of contradictions.\nShe wanted to build a country for the mages, but on the other hand, she was ruthless in her ways. Even if Benjamin and Michelle seemed to be brothers in arms, once Benjamin got in her way, she would probably show no mercy just to get him out of the way.\nShe did indirectly kill half of the mages in the kingdom without hesitation, right?\nThis woman was really something.\nAfter he returned to the Lithur household, he did not receive any news from Michelle. Thus, all of this was just him stabbing wildly in the dark, nothing can be confirmed.

Thankfully, his concerns were disproved when the new rune emerged.\nThese two runes were like reflections of each other in a mirror. Their strength was equal.\nTo categorize it, Benjamin decided to name them as the ‘Water Rune’ and ‘Ice Rune’ respectively. He thought about using a cooler name, such as ‘Emblem · Water’ and ‘Emblem · Ice’, but the System immediately laughed at how pompous they sounded. He had no choice but to give up after that.\nAfter the names were chosen, Benjamin began his new experiment.\nHe started meditating and controlling the water particles to gather in the direction of the Water Rune. It did not take long for the water particles to come into contact with the Water Rune, and as usual, the rune glowed slightly as it absorbed the particles.\nMeanwhile, the Ice Rune, which was floating 20 meters away, glowed in unison with the Water Rune.\nBenjamin took note of the observation, nodding as he sunk into deep thought.\nAfter he confirmed the strength of the two triangular symbols, he was confident of his hypothesis.\nIt was exactly as he thought! Benjamin was not fooled by the distance between the symbols now. He understood that the relation between the two runes was as tight as one between a human and his other self in an alternative timeline. When he commanded the Water Rune to absorb the water particles, the particle was divided into two in a split second, and was absorbed by both the Water and Ice Runes.\nThis will be interesting.\nCould it be that this was related to the pure blue space that he was in before? If it was, then this will not be something that he could thoroughly understand in this period of time.\nBenjamin was in a good mood. Even though his understanding of the runes was only preliminary, he was not anxious about it. He knew that there was no use for him to worry excessively over this, as it would be much better for him to take it slow and learn it one step at a time.\nNow, there was another pressing matter that he had to attend to.\nIt was time for him to condense the third magical rune.\nWithout hesitation, he chanted the spell and summoned a little water ball. He let it levitate in the air. Then, as usual, he commanded the water particles to gather towards the water ball.\nHowever, the water ball did not let out a ‘ding’ like it did previously.\nInstead, it exploded with a ‘bang’.\nBenjamin was dumbfounded.

Although he was not the real him when he was in his Space, but what if he could sustain an injury here? He was unwilling to take this risk.\nIn a blink of an eye, the water particles came in contact with the ice crystal.\nBang!\nBenjamin shook his head helplessly.

Instead, he merely gathered the water particles together and tried to condense them. Bang!\nDumbfounded, Benjamin stared at the dispersed water particles.\nStop f*cking banging, for God’s sake, there is nothing for you to destroy with your explosion!\nNow, he really ran out of ideas. Divine Arts 101 did not have much information on this particular way of training, and they did not mention whether it would be particularly difficult when one is condensing their third rune. Thus, he had no clue on what he should do to handle the present situation.\nAs they say, deviating from the mainstream is never easy.\nBenjamin felt as if he spent the whole of his life downloading a game, but once he opened the downloaded file, an error message popped up: ‘There is an error in the application, the data cannot be read.

It was for the people aged between fourteen and twenty four throughout the kingdom. Those who were ugly could enjoy steaks and champagne and those who were attractive could talk about romance. If not, they could also talk about nonsense and make fun of the laughing stock. In short, everyone could find their own entertainment here.\nHowever, this was not the case for Benjamin.\nAt least, Benjamin never thought so, because in the past he was the laughing stock of the group. For this reason, Benjamin tried to avoid these kind of gatherings as much as possible. If he did not want to go, he would not go, otherwise Claude would not have had to personally request his attendance.\nHowever, the current Benjamin did not think much of it anymore.\nHonestly, he even felt curious.\nHe was never really involved in these kind of social events in the past. The most \"social\" place he had been was probably just a KTV center. He really wanted to know what these high class social people were up to.\nThe purpose of the royal ball hosted by the royal family was to celebrate the princess’ birthday.\nBenjamin was quite excited to meet the princess after the System explained the purpose of the ball to him. The System then quickly continued its next sentence: \"The princess will be two years old soon. You have actually met the princess once. She was held in the arms of her nanny and blew a bubble out of her nose. You laughed very loudly at that time and you were scolded by Claude when he heard about it.\"\n\"...\"\nHis anticipation quickly vanished after the explanation.\nThe royal ball would be separated into two venues. Claude and Mary would go to the \"grown up\" royal ball which is located at the main hall of the palace whereas Benjamin was heading to the youngster’s royal ball which is located at a high class restaurant near the palace.\nBenjamin was very happy about the separate locations of the royal ball. He even hoped that the two locations to be further apart from each other so that he would not be able to meet Claude who would annoyingly give him a lecture.\nBenjamin’s intention to going to the royal ball was not only to see the world.\nHe even planned to probe information of the Church’s movement from the other aristocrats."

However, these rich playboys at the royal ball would definitely blurt out the secrets they overheard from their parents when they were drunk.\nWith this ulterior motive at place, Benjamin entered the royal ball as the restaurant’s servants greeted him at the entrance.\nThe restaurant’s quality was topnotch since it was chosen as the venue for the royal ball. This restaurant, named Ross, claimed to have the nation’s best chef and the most grand interior decoration. The size of this restaurant was definitely bigger than the Lithur mansion. It was obvious that the restaurant had invested a lot of money into its decoration as they had murals painted across the ceiling and lamp shades made out of crystals.\nAlthough it was no match for the high quality restaurant in movies from the previous world, it was enough to stun Benjamin.\nThe price at the restaurant was out of this world, so much so that typical aristocrats wouldn’t even frequent the place. But the royal family was so wealthy that they booked the entire first and second floor of the restaurant, including the rooftop and the balcony for the royal ball.\nBenjamin could only say that no commoner could understand the royal family’s extravagant expenditures.\nUnder the guidance of the servant, he passed through the corridor and arrived at the main hall of the first floor.\nThere were a lot of young aristocrats wearing suits or dresses there and Benjamin predicted there were at least a hundred people as he glanced through the main hall.\nThe aroma of the steaks and wines along with the performance of the pianist by the side projected a very fun yet graceful atmosphere.\nBenjamin felt hungry as he admired his surroundings.\nHowever, no one would go for the food the moment they arrive the royal ball. He would definitely get scolded by Claude if he were to know about this. Hence, Benjamin had no choice but to resist himself and look at the crowd instead.\nHe glanced around but he did not see any familiar faces at all.\nWhere was Grant? Didn’t he arrive already?\nBenjamin smiled as he recalled the day Grant hid in the blanket with someone else. Grant must had hid himself somewhere with his lover doing what lovers do.\nBesides Grant, Dick was the only other aristocrat Benjamin was familiar with.\nDick, as the son of the capital’s aristocrat, would definitely attend the royal ball and Benjamin had already found him in the crowd.

This generation’s Pope is the sixth generation and he had been so for 45 years now. Thus far, the current Pope had not shown himself for the past eight years and everything was managed by the Bishop.\nThe church’s reason for the Pope’s lack of presence for the past eight years was : His Highness the Pope is currently trying to communicate with the God’s will as he tries to persuade God to revoke the punishment of this continent.\nNaturally, the loyal believers did not question anything regarding it. However as time passed, the general public’s dependence to the church had declined. There were rumors that the Pope was already long dead and the bishop had not revealed the Pope’s death as he wanted to gain control of the church.\nNaturally, not many people believed in such a rumor and everybody dared not to discuss about it publicly as well. If the church’s believers were to find out about it, the one who spoke of such topic would be captured in the name of defaming the Pope and would never be released again from the purification center.\nThere were all the information Benjamin had on the Pope. He inquired the System when the girl said the word \"Pope\" but the System could not give him any more information.\nBenjamin was in a deep thought once he confirmed the information.\nWho would have thought…\nThe church’s big movement was not because of the mage but the Pope.\nThat explained the disappearance of the holy knight who was protecting him. If this assassin did bring any harm to the Pope or had seen the church’s secret, the church would definitely attempt to capture this assassin first before continuing other tasks.\nAfter some thought, he questioned again: \"It’s been a long time since they summoned the holy knights. Do you mean that the assassin has yet to be captured?\"\nThe girl lifted her eyebrows with an unfathomable expression and nodded her head.\n\"...\"\nThis lady seemed to be acting exaggerated. There was no need to show such expression as she could just nod her head. You’re not some spy from other countries to reveal the church’s great conspiracy.\nAt this moment, Benjamin realized that the girl had been absorbed by the conversation.\nHowever, if the assassin had yet to be caught...\nThis was actually a good news to Benjamin as the church would pay much less attention to him if they were busy dealing with mages and spies from other countries. Benjamin could move freely once again as today marked the end of Claude’s grounding towards him.\nIt would be so much more convenient for him to do anything from now on.\nAt the time being, Benjamin could go find Annie’s relics as there was no need to play hide and seek with the church.\nHe did not need to worry about exposing his identity as a mage as long as he’s being careful."

He patted Elizabeth on her shoulders. \"You don’t have to be too nervous, either. You are the one the oracle spoke of twenty years ago, everyone at the academy is anticipating your arrival, I’m sure you will be warmly received.\"\nElizabeth heard this and smiled. She shook her head, eyes unblinking, her gaze fell in front of her on nothing in particular.\n\"Teacher, I understand, I am not nervous.\" She said\nThe old mage seemed like he might have wanted to continue, but seeing this, he held his tongue, adding on to the silence of the carriage."

The cross was tailor-made by the church, and they were afraid that the Pope would know that they were being lazy and resting. That was why they avoided you like the plague.\"\nBenjamin turned and saw Coach Dean standing behind him with his arms crossed.\nDean shrugged, \"Why should I be afraid? You don’t have the surveillance cross on you. The Pope will never know a thing even if I start screaming like a banshee here.\"\nBenjamin could not help but chuckle, \"Huh, looks like you’re quite familiar with the events yesterday.\"\nThe Kingdom’s Army belonged to the royals, and received orders from the church. As a Coach in the Kingdom’s Army, Dean must know quite a lot.\n\"I’m not only familiar with it,\" Dean snorted with pride as Benjamin expected, \"I heard from the Coach in the Knight’s Battalion right beside us that a noble brat left the place before the Pope appeared. He tried to stop the brat, but he was shouted at instead. He was so furious that he woke everyone in the Knight’s Battalion yesterday in the middle of the night and ordered them to run through the night. I would make a modest guess that it was you. Am I right?\"\nAfter he heard this, Benjamin looked at the Knights Battalion beside their camp in shock.\nWhat a coincidence!\nNo wonder the shouts he heard from them were much weaker today.\nStill, it was amazing that the few Royal Knights that stopped him yesterday was here in the Kingdom Army, training the recruits. Fate really could work in mysterious ways.\nIf the knight knew that Benjamin was here, he would probably rush over and teach him a hard lesson.\nBenjamin was helpless in this; on the streets, he was a highly noble while a Royal Knight was just a lowly knight. However, in the training base, Benjamin was a mere recruit while the knight was a high-rank officer! The environment could really play a decisive role in one’s status.\nWhen Benjamin realised this, he promptly started to flatter Dean, \"Oh, coach! You’re such a stunningly handsome man!\"\nDean roared in laughter. He shook his head as he comforted Benjamin, \"Alright alright, enough. I will not inform him that you’re here. What are you afraid of, anyways? You’re my recruit; he had no jurisdiction to teach you a lesson.\"\n\"Yes yes yes, sir, whatever you say is absolutely true.\"\nDean shook his head again, his lips pulled up into a smile.\n\"Oh, right,\" Benjamin finally asked the question that had been bothering him after cracking enough jokes and when the atmosphere finally brightened, \"How did you find out that I do not have those crosses on me?\""

Benjamin was not blind - he would have definitely noticed a cross embedded in his younger brother’s palm during breakfast.\nThere was no doubt that Grant did not ‘wear’ the surveillance cross too.\nWhy?\nThe answer could not be because ‘Grant was hiding in the store room committing homosexual behavior’. That was too far-fetched for Benjamin to believe although this was a fantasy world. There must be another explanation.\n\"My brother was also at the party. He did not have a cross in his palm though,\" Benjamin told Dean without hesitation. He was not worried about Dean getting suspicious; everyone in the kingdom was terrified now, and all of them were trying to know as much as they could about the situation. It would be more suspicious of him if he looked like he did not care about what was happening.\n\"Bullshit. Don’t you know who your brother is?\" Dean scoffed, \"The cross has no effect on casters of the Divine Arts, much less on your brother, who is the famed next-in-line of the Pope. There was no need for the church to put him on surveillance!\" Benjamin nodded, \"Ah, that’s the reason huh….\"\nThe surveillance cross could only work on ordinary people. This piece of information could be crucial. Speaking of Dean’s comment, ‘There was no need for the church to put him on surveillance!’, Benjamin wanted to silently comment that yes, the church should really get to know what Grant was up to in his free time.\nJokes aside, if Benjamin did not get out of the ball in time, he would get the cross implant. As he was a mage, the cross would fail, and his identity would have been revealed to the Pope instantly. Just thinking of it gave Benjamin cold sweat.\n\"You nobles must be running amok now; all your dirty secrets are there for the church to see,\" Dean continued as Benjamin was still silently thankful for his luck, \"Now tell me, when will you people start a riot right at the doors of the church?\"\nBenjamin could only laugh dryly. After Dean provided him some information, it was now time for him to return the favour. Fair enough, but unfortunately, he had nothing to give.\n\"I have no idea,\" Benjamin shook his head, \"Neither my brother or I got the surveillance cross. We are the only two noble youths in the family, and since this incident did not impact our family, we’re basically ignoring it. Even if these people wanted to stage protest against the church, they wouldn’t come after us.\"\nThe Lithur household was indeed very fortunate in this.

Don’t even dream of lunch if you do not complete it.\"\nOver thirty noble households marched towards St. Peter’s Cathedral today to seek explanation for the way the Holy Knights treated their children in the ball. Dean’s prediction was right; the nobles would stage a protest.\nIt was unfortunate for the nobles that the church’s response was swift. Before they could even gather, they were chased away by more than 10 Holy Knights.\nThe nobles did not give up without a fight though. After they were chased away, they went and sat in silent protest at the entrance of the castle after some discussions. They were still there, unmoved even after Benjamin finished his lunch in the Lithur Manor.\nIf there was more people present, Benjamin heavily suspected that they would start a demonstration.\nAll this was a nuisance to Benjamin. The royal family and the church must already predicted this situation when they decided to execute their plan. These nobles who were running about in the kingdom were basically acting like clowns in the church; they should instead utilize whatever available resources and influence they have to do something that would actually threaten the church.\nAfter all, only less than forty nobles households were present. It was barely a force to be reckoned by the church; there were more than a few hundred noble households and more than ten major ones in the kingdom.\nThese major noble households did not even squeak.\nAfter Benjamin gathered enough information, he had a nagging thought: the church’s collusion with the royal family was a very deliberately planned one.\nInitially, there were a few hundred people in the ball, but the crowd reduced gradually throughout the night. Some were like Elizabeth and Dick who left early, and some were like Benjamin who left and were not stopped. At last, only approximately a hundred noble youths were obligated to ‘wear’ the cross.\nThe actual number of noble households under surveillance was only slightly more than sixty - most of them were siblings belonging to the same households that were forced to ‘wear’ the cross.\nThat God’s will to ‘cleanse all mages in the land’ was also used by the church as a weapon to suppress unrest; those who were displeased with the measures taken were automatically assumed to be working with the mages."

Maybe they were plotting something outside of their children’s surveillance, but for now, the nobles seemed to finally accept and obey the church.\nThose that were not involved kept their silence; perhaps they were still grateful that their children escaped this tragedy. It was as if everyone forgot about the agreement they had before and were willing to accept the church’s unlawful behavior.\nThe nobles finally understood how wide the gap of power between the church and the nobles had become since the formation of the kingdom. Hundreds of years ago, the nobles possessed army forces; hundreds of years later, the nobles only possessed gold, gold that could be taken away at the church’s whims.\nBenjamin knew that if the nobles did nothing to change the situation, their gold would soon be no more.\nFor the Lithurs, their status was a result for their obedience to church; Claude ignored the current happenings in the kingdom, instead he focused on tending to the lands he owned, as if the focus of his life was to give more offerings to the kingdom and the church.\nOf course, Benjamin was entirely against this approach. It was impossible for the Lithurs to survive if the kingdom collapsed due to its internal conflicts! Benjamin’s opinions did not seem to matter much to the household, though.\nSince he could not do much about this, he might as well stop worrying about this.\nHe did not forget to ask about the Woods. According to them, Elizabeth, the only daughter in their household, retired early on the night of the ball as she was ill. However, she caught on a sudden disease after her return, and unfortunately perished the next morning. Her body was cremated before the priest of the church arrived at the scene in an effort to stop the disease from spreading. By the time the priest was there, she was no more.\nBenjamin refused to believe in the news. Elizabeth, the talkative girl who was lively enough to pull Benjamin to a dance, died that night?\nAs he recalled Elizabeth’s words, \"I’m leaving the kingdom tonight,\", he combined this piece of information with the fact that her ‘body’ was no more, Benjamin took mere seconds to guess what was going on.\nThe Woods probably heard the rumors and decided for their daughter to forge her death and hide somewhere outside the kingdom.

Do you really think you’re still a 16 year old lad?\" The System chided, slightly baffled, \"Stop dreaming now, go on, do what you need to do.\"\nBenjamin did not get angry, \"Well, we always need some chicken soup in our lives, no?\"\n\"Eh, when it’s a chicken soup that’s been aging for decades, it’ll be too stale for use.\"\n\"Judging by the amount of preservatives in the chicken soups, it will never go past its expiry date.\"\n\"Your ambition musician just hugged you while he begged to change his occupation to become a beggar.

Perhaps the movies were real; mafia leaders would usually have a weird temperament. Would the ones in the outskirts of Havenwright be an exclusion?\nBenjamin took a deep breath before he entered the place. The first thing he saw was the narrow lobby and a reception desk, and behind it sat a balding old man. Benjamin saw no one else; the inn was oddly silent.\nThe old man briefly glanced at him before he dipped his chin as he continued reading his newspaper.\nBenjamin walked over and said, \"Excuse me, do you know where is Chief Silverfox?\"\nThe old man set aside his newspaper as he squinted at Benjamin in apparent distaste, \"Why do you want to know?\"\nBenjamin did not let that affect him. After all, he was disguised as a beggar; he expected to be seen as such. The people who could start a business nowadays are usually the materialistic sort.\nInstead, he laughed and took a golden coin out of his pocket. He threw it offhandedly on the desk, and it made a heavy sound as it hit the surface.\n\"I need him to help me find someone.\"\nThe old man looked surprised. He picked up the golden coin and studied it; he even placed it between his teeth and bit. After he verified that the golden coin was genuine, he once again looked at Benjamin in confusion.\n\"Is there something wrong with you? You’re rich, why do you want to look like a beggar?\"\n\"...\"\nBenjamin held onto his moral belief in respecting the elderly and treating the youth with respect, and ignored the old man’s words. He repeated his purpose, \"Where is Chief Silverfox? I need his help to find someone.\"\n\"You’re the mafia lord?\"\nThe old man once again looked disgusted, \"I am no mafia lord.\"\nBenjamin was confused, \"Why did you say that you’re Chief Silverfox then?\"\n\"Because I am Chief Silverfox.\"\n\"Shouldn’t Chief Silverfox be a mafia lord?\"\n\"Who told you that Chief Silverfox must be a mafia lord?\"\n\"...\"\nBenjamin was made speechless.

He quickly bowed his head and let his hair cover his face, as if he was terrified. He could only hope that the priest did not recognise him.\n\"Welcome, sirs, how can I help you?\" The old man’s face was like a chameleon; it switched so fast as he fawned over the four.

At this moment, he suddenly remembered the crazy people he met that never had their safety on.\nHe suddenly seemed to understand their actions.\nIt was addicting, carrying an active pistol around.\nAs he thought about that, Benjamin shut his eyes and once again activated Water Particle Detection.\nBecause he was close enough, everything in the room seemed to be a painting shone in blue light once he focused all of his attention to it. The positioning of the furniture, the shut windows, the wardrobe door that was left ajar …... All of this was displayed in his mind, clear as day. He could also see the location of the 4 people.\nHowever, when he had the intention to shoot when he scanned the scene, there seemed to be a change to his vision.\nThe shooting interface appeared out of nowhere and integrated itself into the display of the water particles. It guided him on how to aim and shoot efficiently. The familiar figures and gunsight were now shrouded in a veil of blue.\nBenjamin was very pleasantly surprised. The Water Particle Detection could be combined with the shooting interface? Although he had no idea how this could happen, but it saved Benjamin by the bell.\nNow, there was no need for him to take some time to prepare his shots!"

The old man wanted to protect the assassin. If the assassin was killed, there was no way that the old man would be satisfied even if Benjamin managed to kill the enemies.\nThat was why Benjamin took action immediately. He recalled the training he had in the gunfire regime as he appeared in front of the door and pulled the trigger before the four could even catch up to the situation.\nFour continuous shots aimed at four different targets. If Benjamin did not have the training from the gunfire regime and only relied on the shooting interface, it would be difficult for him to do this. Still, Benjamin was successful.\nAfter the shots were heard, the three Holy Knights collapsed, blood spraying out from the hole in their foreheads and the back of their heads. They did not wear their helmets, and the Armour of Holy Light they wore on their body was of no help as well. It merely clanked as they fell.\nIt was extremely difficult to avoid the shots from an aimed gun, especially when they were unaware of it. However, only three clanking noises were heard.\nBenjamin’s face darkened as he immediately kept the gun that ran out of its ammunition. He started to chant his spells as he prepared himself with magic.\nThe ambush did not fully succeed.\nThe fourth bullet was aimed at the priest. But it wasn’t that the priest had amazing reflexes to block the bullet with the divine arts. It was that when the bullet was about to hit him, a Holy Barrier suddenly appeared. The Blessed bullet hit and broke the glinting barrier, but the bullet itself was nudged off course.\nThat was why the priest survived the deliberate surprise attack.\nFrankly, Benjamin did not expect that the priest would have defensive magical instruments.\nFortunately, he did not expect to kill off all four of them by merely using bullets. He was still mentally prepared for this. As this was an ambush, he was still a step ahead.\n\"What’s going on? You-\"\nThe priest just realised what happened after he looked at the Holy Knights lying on the floor around him. He turned around in shock and looked at Benjamin, who stood firmly by the door.\nInstead, what he saw was 6 water bombs. Wham!\nWater splashed everywhere as it drowned the priest.\nBut Benjamin did not relax.\nHe could clearly see via the Water Particle Detection that another cross that hung on the chest of the priest broke into pieces when another Holy Barrier appeared to block the attack. The stunned priest was safe under its protection.\n\"Fuck...\"\nBenjamin could not help but curse.\nHow many magical instruments does this priest have on him?\nIt blocked the bullet and the 6 water bombs; this tiny thing single-handedly ruined his perfect plan of attack and his brilliant usage of timing!"

He did not ponder on it for long and assumed that it was just the problem between the triangular runes and the Space. However, it did not take him long to feel that something was off.\nWill the water element reject other magical elements?\nIn this world, every magical elements was mixed together. The water element was not an exception; why would it behave violently with the other elements in the Space when it was amicable with them outside of it?\nBenjamin found the answer after he carefully compared both circumstances.\nThe water particles in the Space were imprinted with Benjamin’s spiritual energy when it was absorbed into the Space.\nHis spiritual energy was probably altered by the runes and became slightly different. The most obvious aspect was the water particles that has his spiritual energy imprinted on it will have the tendency to repel other magical elements.\nHe once gave some thought on the possibility to use this characteristic to innovate some new ways to navigate around his magic. He did not come up with any good ideas then, which was why he ignored this problem."

It was at that moment when he realised that he could utilize this special repelling force of the water particles to stop the gathering of the holy light, which would in turn interrupt the enemy’s divine charm.\nNot only that, he just finished casting some spells. After the spells ended and returned to their original state, the water particles still had the remnants of Benjamin’s spiritual energy imprinted on them.\nHe could use these accumulated water particles.\nThat was why Benjamin immediately chanted a spell and focused all of his attention to gather the massive amount of water particles to form a water ball and trap the priest within. That completely cut off the priest from the holy light from outside the water ball.\nEven Benjamin did not expect such a stellar anti-magic effect from this water ball!\nThe priest was jailed in, and could only manipulate a very limited amount of holy light that was under the protection of the Holy Barrier. Now, the priest would be unable to cast any intermediate charms; hell, Benjamin suspected that he could not even do a Grenade of Holy Light.\nNow, the results of the battle was clear.\nBenjamin won!\nA caster without magical elements will just be a helpless plebeian.\nTo Benjamin, the priest now was just like a fish on a chopping board, whose life is for anyone to take.\nHowever, Benjamin knew that this Anti-Magic Waterball will not be easy to maintain - it was very obvious from the mild pain and dizziness he felt now. The priest was still trying to summon the holy lights as the water particles violently shoved the light particles out. However, Benjamin’s spiritual energy was drained by the minute.\nHe needed to consciously maintain the anti-magic characteristic of the water ball, and his spiritual energy was not strong enough for him to waste any.\nHe should really end this battle as soon as possible.\nOne round… Two rounds…\nStill water does no harm, but when it starts moving, it is a totally different story.\nBenjamin named this spell as the Water Vortex Prison.\nAs he ignored the System’s comment that ‘this name is terrible and pompous’, he guided the flow of water and made it flow rapidly. The water tore through the space as the pull within the water ball became stronger.\nSoon, a vortex was formed in the water ball.\nThe best part of this spell was that once the vortex was created, Benjamin did not need to focus on it anymore. As long as he gave the water ball a small push, the vortex would spin faster and faster.\n\"What... What is this?\"\nThe priest exclaimed, still trapped within the vortex.\nThe Holy Barrier and the Shield of the Holy Spirit that protected him from harm cracked with a sickening noise.

They used these as excuses to exterminate all the mercenary’s bases back in the days. The commoners of this would not even know what a mercenary was if one were to question them.\nAnd this old man was a mercenary back in his prime days?\nThe mercenaries were people who risked their lives on the daily basis.\nIt was now clear why he was very calm when he went against the church’s henchman and did not hesitate when he cooperated with Benjamin.\n\"You don’t see any mercenaries anymore in the kingdom these days. The church had not started cleaning up the mercenaries yet when I was at my prime. One out of five people, especially near the west of the mountains, was a mercenary.\" Traces of nostalgia could be heard in the old man’s voice. \"Now… there’s nothing left. Everybody said I would live a long life, but no one expected that I would live for so long. Those battle buddies back in the days are either dead or have left this kingdom. I am the only one left alive with no purpose in this realm.\"\nBenjamin could hear loneliness in his voice.\nTruthfully, he could not believe that the old man had once led an extremely dangerous lifestyle. Judging from the special position the old man was currently in, he must have been an excellent mercenary back in his days.\nThat was why he was called the Chief Silverfox, someone who was more superior than a typical gang leader."

I would have died in the Church’s hand if not for these people’s assistance. You may feel that I am a very special person, but I am actually just repaying the debts I have owed.\" Benjamin nodded his head as if he was deep in thought after hearing him out.

The aristocrats were their next target.\nFor so many years, the Church has been making small moves, only changing their target over time. All the unstable elements in the kingdom were suppressed one after another.\nBenjamin could not help but think that the word \"aristocrats\" would be foreign to everyone in a few decades if the church did not stop their actions.\nHowever, if the church really were to completely eradicate the aristocrats’ power and build a purely religious kingdom, it might require the church to exert some extraordinary power and skills in order to achieve that.\nSomeone would definitely stop the church.\nAt the very least, the aristocrats with power would definitely not let it happened very easily. Although the aristocrats looked like they have surrendered, they would definitely plot their countermeasures in the dark. This is the true strengths of the aristocrats.\nPerhaps, at this moment, the powerful aristocrats are having a meeting now.\nBenjamin was thinking of these.\nAt the same time, somewhere in the kingdom.\nThere was actually a secret meeting by the kingdom’s aristocrats to curb the Church’s intention to remove their power.\nThere was a remote house in a small village in Pearl Valley, located at the northern region of the kingdom. Although it looked like an abandoned house, there was quite a crowd gathering inside it.\nIf Benjamin was there, he would recognize a few familiar faces such as Accius Fulner.\nThere were about ten to twenty people in the room. With the exception of the Lithur household, all of the aristocrat’s representatives of the highest status in the kingdom were present.\nThey gathered at the round table and they seemed to be in discussion.\n\"Duke Accius, are you sure the church does not know that we have gathered here?

However…...\nAfter some thought, Benjamin curiously asked: \"I thought you would leave the capital to lay low for a while. However, it sounds like you plan to stay around for a bit.\"\nAlthough Benjamin was the one who killed the people, the church would not be able to relate the killing to Benjamin. Same could not be said to the old man from the hotel. The name \"Chief Silverfox\" was well known in this land. The church would definitely be able to find him.\nIt was not like Benjamin was kind or worried about the old man. He was afraid that he would be placed in a dangerous situation if the old man were to be caught by the church as they would definitely extract his memory.\nHis impersonation of the beggar was a success as the priest was not able to recognize him until his death.

The design was quite similar to the ones given by the Bishop. Wearing it would not raise any suspicion.\nAwesome!\nSigh...\nWait a minute.\nJust as Benjamin was putting away the necklace, he suddenly had a concern.\nMichelle said the cross necklace was from a minister she killed. This made Benjamin recall the priest that he just took down.\nOne glance at the deceased priest and you could tell he was the filthy rich type.

However, if compared with rebels infiltrating the Church, the latter would take the cake.\nObviously, Father Reuben understood the gravity of this and immediately was in concord with the other priest to leave the murder at hand and leave for the Church.\nAnd there Benjamin was; idling at the secret pathway’s entrance and an opportunity came knocking by.\nNot so much of a bad luck after all.\nThe priest cast a Divine Charm onto the bodies to preserve the scene. This was to prevent to corpses from deteriorating. They ordered a Holy Knight to guard the doorway and the two quickly made haste to the Church.\nThe two priests left.\nOf course, he would have to take care of this Holy Knight first.\nTo prevent disturbance by intruders, there were many Holy Knights on guard in the hotel. Through Benjamin’s Water Particle Detection, he could sense that there were another seven to eight men, and that is just the number for those within his range.\nIf he were to alert the Holy Knights, he would not have the chance to go through the body.\nUsing a gun would be out of the question. The Ice Needle would be his best shot. However, he could only use them in close range. Another issue would be that he was unsure whether magical spells would alert the Holy Knights.\nThe Cleaners’ specialty was that they could detect any magical spells, but what did they rely on? If it was a magical instrument, then who was to say that perhaps one of the Holy Knights would be carrying one of these tools as well?\nIf one of them really carried it, he would be doomed.\nAfter careful consideration, he believed that he should be more cautious in his execution.\nThen what should he do?\nHe thought again and again. Suddenly, he stood up and ran in the opposite direction of the tunnel. After running for about ten minutes or so, he stopped and chanted the Icebreaking Spell.\nThis was what he came up with.\nIf his worry was that magic would sound the alarm, then he could simply use it further away."

As the eldest son to the old King of the Empire, His Royal Highness the Prince did not inherit the throne. Benjamin did not understand what had happened in the past. However, if the second son was able to compete for the throne with the eldest son, the second son must have possessed better qualities than the eldest.\nIf having an outstanding younger brother was bad enough, try having a younger sister who quietly obtained troops to conquer the widest amount of land.

The Church could easily vanquish the Carretas without the interference of the two other Kingdoms.\nThis would probably have to be delayed.\nIf the eldest prince is pinning all his hope on the Church, he would be dreadfully disappointed.\nAfter reading the letter, Benjamin thought for a while. He finally decided to tear the letter to bits and bury it. It was a matter between nations and beyond his control. If he were to reveal even the slightest bit of knowledge on this matter, he may be placing himself in grave danger.\nHe did not intend to warn the Queen of Icor or the King of Ferelden.

It was as if he merely took a leisurely walk this afternoon.\nAt this moment, he has just finished dinner and was seated on his own bed, looking at the small mirror in his hand.\nAfter leaving the prison ruins, he did not return home immediately. Although he was worried about the Church’s attack, the Church was currently in a frenzied state and definitely would not be able to respond quickly. Thus, before the Church began their search, he could move around without too much concern.\nThis was why he went to the \"same old place\" Michelle told him about, found the third tree and dug up Annie’s things.\nAlthough Annie betrayed Michelle and their relationship was all sorts of pretenses and facades, her parting words were true.\nShe had indeed left Michelle some things, but Michelle had ignored them. If it were not for Benjamin’s obsession, these things might be buried under the withered tree forever, never to see sunlight or the sky again.\nFortunately, he went and was rewarded.\nThe mirror in his hand was one of the magical instruments Annie left behind.\nBut for reasons unknown, he felt that this mirror was slightly different from the other magical instruments.\nFor example, the ring and cross he acquired from the pastor, Benjamin could feel its slight magical aura at close proximity. But this mirror was different. No matter how close he was, he could feel nothing.\nAnd because of this, he almost mistook it for an ordinary mirror.\nHowever, when he focused his energy on the mirror, the mirror would suddenly emit light and an apparition who looked identical to him would appear in front of him.\nWhen he first saw the apparition, Benjamin was very startled. It was like seeing a ghost during the day. But upon recovering from his astonishment, he discovered that he could use his energy to control this apparition, letting it leap up, jump down or make any vivid expressions."

There was nothing to worry about even if Benjamin used Water Particle Detection to sense the apparition; no flaws could be detected.\nNot only that, he also quickly discovered that whatever the apparition sees, it all showed in the mirror.\nHe immediately realized the immense value this small mirror held.\nNot only can it baffle the opponent and lay down deceits, during extraordinary situations, the apparition summoned can take the place of its master to scope dangerous places.\nReally, this powerful item, how had Annie obtained it?\nEven more peculiar was that she didn’t use it, but instead buried it in the soil and said she left it for Michelle – what in the world was she thinking?\nHe could not understand.\nBut Annie had already died. No matter how puzzled Benjamin was, no one will jump out to answer his doubts anyway. So, he quickly pushed this matter to the back of his mind and focused on exploring this little mirror.\nHowever, a few experiments later, Benjamin regretfully discovered that the distance between him and the apparition cannot be more than 500 meters. He could control the apparition to walk precisely 500 meters from him but if the apparition takes another step forward, it instantly disappears with no trace in sight.\nWhat a pity.\nIf the distance was further, this item could be labeled as a divine instrument.\nBut it was not bad the way it is. Benjamin did not plan on forcing anything. He did not have expectations for the items Annie left behind in the first place, so the discovery of a decent item has already satisfied him.\nPeople cannot be too greedy.\nApart from this mirror, there were not any more valuable items from the pile of Annie’s leftovers. After some thought, Benjamin decided to not throw out some of the items such as a comb, a doll and some small objects. He was prepared to hand them to Michelle when the opportunity arose someday, which also counted as fulfilling Annie’s words during her farewell.\nThinking along those lines, Benjamin sat on the bed, looked over the mirror a few times, and kept it properly. Then, he took out the three magical instruments he plundered from the pastor.\nHe also found their respective uses.\nThe cross pendant functioned to strengthen one’s affinity to the holy light, which was naturally useless to Benjamin, so he stashed it at the bottom of a box, allowing it to gather dust.\nAs for these two rings…\nOne of the rings, when Benjamin wore it, made him feel a slight increase in his energy and naturally lifted his spirits. The other ring, after putting it on, surprisingly made his body feel lighter, as if his movements were a little faster.\nSo it can do this too? He could not help but be surprised."

A ring that promised +2 to energy, another ring which +2 to agility, Benjamin kept them carefully, prepared to wear them when needed -- after all, these were plundered items, he should be careful when it came to using them.\nHe quickly laid on the bed, closed his eyes, entered his consciousness and continued his magical training.\nBut this time, he did not begin meditating.\nHe wanted to begin delving into what was known as \"non-verbal spell casting\".\nThe experience of using ice needles to sneakily attack the Holy Knights reminded him and allowed him to realize the shortcomings of his ambush techniques – in whatever situation, his skills seem to fall short. If he used magic and summoned the Ice Needles first, he would have to toddle back to ambush them. Most of the time, he would need to summon the Ice Needles on the spot and stick them into someone’s shoulder without missing a second.\nAnd because of this, Benjamin thought of non-verbal spell casting.\nIf he could use magic without chanting the spell, then the success rate of his ambushes would increase.\nHe also remembered in the book \"Divine Arts 101\", it was stated that the method of opening up one’s space of consciousness to practice can lead to performing non-verbal spell casting. Unfortunately, the book did not introduce the basics of doing so. Thus, he could only resort to studying himself.\nAfter some thought, he started experimenting in his space of consciousness.\nHe closed his eyes, felt the water particles in his surrounding, spoke the incantation for the Water Ball Spell in his heart and the result was as imagined – nothing happened. But soon, he realized that runes are the foundation of everything, and so he changed his strategy. He began to feel the water runes. At the same time, he focused his energy, chanting the Water Ball Spell silently.\nBenjamin felt a little defeated.\nHe was aware that the release of magic is due to the vibrations of the runes as they guide the surrounding water particles, finally resulting in magic. But if he does not speak the incantation, how else can he make the runes vibrate?\nWith this thought, he walked to face the Water Emblem and stared hard at the shining blue triangular emblem hovering in the air.\nIs it only the Water Ball incantation that can make it vibrate?\nBut ... non-verbal spell casting is all about not speaking the incantation and still allowing magic to be released.\nWhat now? He was out of ideas so he could only stare at the Water Emblem, chanting the incantation again and again in his heart.\nTen times, a hundred times, a thousand times… it was like he was back where he started: He had not opened up his space of consciousness, did not know how to learn magic and could only repeat this short yet profound Water Ball incantation on loop."

He was also worried about the training the next morning, and thought that he should sleep, but there was nothing to be done; practicing magic was too interesting!\nThinking about it, from the day he began learning magic until now, whenever he practiced, he had always been afraid that the waves from magic usage would be detected by others, and so he only dared to practice in the space of consciousness. But now, with non-verbal spell casting, as long as it was not done in front of the Church, he could cast spells without worrying in real life.\nHe was a little addicted to this feeling of freedom.\nLike this, endless repetitions of entering and exiting the space of consciousness, summoning Ice Needles, bringing the Ice Needles into reality, and then disintegrating the Ice Needles made Benjamin feel that this caused even the bedroom’s temperature to drop by almost 10 degrees.\nHe even had to pause, open his closet to wear another shirt, and then only could he proceed with practice.\nAnd this whole non-verbal spell casting exercise continued until 5am.\nHe had to say, staying up to practice was extraordinarily effective. When the practice was done, the whole process was already shortened by Benjamin to nearly one second. This meant that he could, in this short amount of time, whizz into the space of consciousness, use the time difference between the space and reality to complete his magic, and then whiz back out to reality with the magic.\nThis literally... felt like flying.\nHe felt immensely proud at this and at the same time, dizzy.\nRelentlessly practicing non-verbal spell casting meant that he had to go in and out the space of consciousness for 40 times in one minute. Although Benjamin boasted riding roller coasters and drop towers without a change in expression, but to go up and down a drop tower at high speed within a minute, this soured sense of coolness, he really could not fucking stand it.\nAnd especially since it was under the condition that he was staying up late.\nWhen that excitement faded, Benjamin quickly became dizzy and exhausted.\nFurthermore, he suddenly remembered that in less than two hours, the maid would wake him up and he would have to go for military training: run laps, stand at attention, fistfights, gun training…\n...Fuck.\nIn that moment, he wanted to die."

At first glance, it was easy to mistake it for dirty brown.\nAt first glance…\nSuddenly, Benjamin wondered, how did the Church receive the keyword of \"beggar\"?\nWhen he walked into old man Silverfox’s hotel, there were many pedestrians on the street; and there were a lot of customers in the hotel too who were driven away later by Holy Knights. The Church must have begun their search at the hotel and found some pedestrians who were passing by and customers who were escaping in a hurry. And among these people, there might have been a few who accidentally spotted a Benjamin disguised as a beggar as they were leaving.\nThe Church took and read their memories and so could conclude – the beggar who walked into the hotel and squatted at the side with his head down was the culprit who killed the pastor.\nWho would have thought that the Church was pretty good when it came to investigating a case.\nAs for the suspicion on Chief Silverfox… he was pretty famous outside the city so the Church probably found out that he could not be a magician. Therefore, they did not list Chief Silverfox as the murderer.\nLike this, after thinking of the chronological order of this matter, Benjamin felt less uneasy.\nThe fact that the Church could find out so much was indeed surprising, but there was only so much they could find. As long as they cannot catch Chief Silverfox, Benjamin did not have much to worry about.\nTo try and recognize Benjamin from the few pedestrians’ hazy memories of him was basically impossible.\nOf course, if the Church could work backwards through the memories of all the pedestrians, they might be able to draw out the route Benjamin took and maybe even find the pipe organ man who shared a few words with Benjamin at Bonnie’s Pub. But sadly, on the streets outside of the city, not all of them have pedestrians and not all pedestrians have the time to pay attention to beggars on the streets.\nTo use a method like this to uncover even a hair on Benjamin was the same as fishing for a needle in the sea.\nHe was completely at ease.\nPhew….\nThings have indeed gotten out of hand, but as long as he laid low for now, there should not be any problems.

It was like there was a bomber plane dropping bombs in his ears; his sanity was slipping and was very close to being shaken out of this world.\nBenjamin covered his ears and struggled in pain, roaring hysterically.\n--- These blood curdling screams were instead drowned out completely by the echoes of the syllables.\nTime passed slowly, the roaring explosive noise shook the entire pure blue space like a nuclear warhead. The countless odd runes were also blown to bits by this torture, not one was spared.\nVery soon, the whole world was left with only a pure blue space.\nExcept for Benjamin.\nHe was still here, unshaken out of the world, unlike the last time.\nThe surrounding sound was still growing, Benjamin had already lost his consciousness from the sound; his cognitive awareness collapsed like an avalanche on the mountains. It was as if his brain was cooked thoroughly in high temperature; he could not think of anything but only struggle instinctively. It was as if in the next moment, he would faint completely and his whole being would decompose into powder form from this terrifying sound wave.\nHowever, he lasted through every moment."

He really wanted to know, once those three runes came into contact, what would happen?\nBut, he knew, this would take a long time before he could finally see this happening.\nThe runes converging to the center of the triangle was a slow process. He meditated for a few hours just now, and it was a few hours in reality, not a few hours in the space of consciousness; it only made the distance between the runes grow shorter by two centimeters. That half a meter was probably a result of him meditating for the past month.\nBenjamin looked at the three runes again.\nTwenty plus meters, how long would he need to meditate for?\nAlright…..more grinding required.\nHe realised he should take it slow as it was not safe out there. He was on the wanted list by the Church. Why not just remain home and stay low, meditate more and cause less trouble?"

Then, he fully focused on meditation, and started his magic training to continue strengthening the three runes relentlessly.\nHe was immersed in magic, and time flew by quickly. Other than going to eat at the living hall, all his time was spent on meditating. He did not step outside the house at all, Grant asked him to tag along for a new war simulation game, but he declined Grant with the excuse of what happened to him last time.\nHe was not that well known in the nobles’ circle; if this continued, people would probably forget that he even existed. The military training was cancelled under Claude’s order; the Church was busy searching for him; and Michelle’s whereabouts were unknown after she embarked on the journey for the treasury; and no one came to bother him at all.\nNothing happened; he just remained in his own room, meditating, severing his connections to the outside world for now.\nAbout the deal he made with Chief Silverfox…..\nBenjamin wanted to take a look at the dungeon site as well, to see if there was any news about that ‘bamboo shoot’. But he had no choice, the Church was after him, and their security tightened day by day. A few days ago, some Holy Knights even came to their house to do a search.\nOut of due respect to the Lithur family, their search was not too strict. If not, they probably would have found all the items that Benjamin had hoarded. Benjamin quickly found a new hiding spot for those items due to the searches by the Church.\nUnder these circumstances, how could he even dare to try to go to the dungeon site?\nThe secret passage in the hotel was most likely discovered by the people from the Church. That abandoned dungeon site would probably have been locked down by increased security. Benjamin was confident in Chief Silverfox’s plans; he could probably leave a message under the rock as he had promised, but Benjamin had no confidence in himself!\nWhat if the Church left their men at the site? Going to the dungeon would be of no difference from walking directly into their trap.\nHe could only pray that the Church would stop their operation earlier so that no one had discovered Chief Silverfox’s message, and that ‘bamboo shoot’ had not moved around at this time.\nLuckily, the Church and their search did not last long.\nTen days later, on an afternoon, when Jeremy was tidying up his room, he told Benjamin that the Church had found the person that they were looking for.\nThey caught someone? What the hell?\nHe was still standing here, so who did the Church actually capture?\nIn his expectations, the Church would not give up on this matter just because they could not capture any one.

The Church was saying that they retrieved the letter, where on earth did they find it?\nAt the moment, Benjamin knew the Church was bluffing.\nThey did not find anyone, but because they had too many pressing matters and did not have the ability to continue their search, the Church gave out a bulletin saying they had found that person after thorough searching just to save their own faces.\nRight...this was most likely the case.\nBenjamin also thought about the fact that they captured the wrong person. But if they caught the wrong person, why did they have to say that they retrieved the letter?\nOf course, it could be that this kind of manhunt has been blown out of proportions, and they could not find the person. They purposefully created this piece of fake news to make the person who took the letter to let their guard down, but still continue the search behind the scenes.\nBut, the possibility of this was not huge.\nIn this period of time, the Church has expended all their manpower. The nobles were causing trouble for them by secretly recruiting people to stir up issues in the territories outside the city, making faithful believers begin questioning the Church.

The inner ranks of the kingdom still had many unsolved problems, yet they still went ahead to Carretas to create more problems for themselves. Their whole operation would fall apart if there were any mistakes.\nBenjamin became that small mistake that stopped their gears from turning.\nAt this moment, he suddenly realized that when he took the letter away, he changed the structure of a few countries by accident as well."

After obtaining this information, he smashed the rock into powder, and quickly left the prison ruins for the carpentry shop at the east side of the city.\nHe has gotten his hands on the information, and there was not much room left for hesitation, he could only continue on.\nOther than that, when he left the prison ruins, he was careful to not let anyone other person see him to prevent himself from becoming the suspect -- two more holy knights have died, the Church was probably livid now.\nBecause of this, he tried to use all the secluded shortcuts. After two hours, he finally arrived at the carpentry at the east of the city.\n--This place that Chief Silverfox had left him the location for.\nThe carpentry shop was located on one of the main streets of the outer city. The shop was not huge or extravagant, but it was rather famous. The owner had great workmanship, and sometimes nobles would come all the way here for specialized orders.\nIf he remembered correctly, in the beginning when Benjamin wanted to distract the Church, he made Jeremy run errands, and he sent Jeremy here a few of times. The boss of this place was tortured by his \"he would know\" sentence until he fell sick, and only recently reopened business.\nThinking of this, Benjamin could only nod his head.\nWhat else could he say, it was fate!"

Did my useless son cause trouble again?\"\nLuckily, the person he wanted to find was really here.\nBut ... that eccentric assassin was this carpenter’s son? This was the part that shocked Benjamin.

But it had to be due to Benjamin’s polite tone and his noble fashion choices today that after some hesitation, the carpenter nodded.\n\"Sir, he is in the backyard, just go in from the side door and he will be there.\"\nSaying this, the carpenter led Benjamin to a small entrance at the side of the shop.\nHe opened the door and shouted: \"Sean, there’s a nobleman wanting to see you, did you get into trouble again?\"\nAfter a while, from a distance: \"Dad, I have caused tons of trouble, which one are you talking about?\"\n\"...\"\nThe carpenter took a deep breath, turned around, then faced Benjamin and awkwardly smiled: \"Sir, I’m sorry about that, just head in from this door and you will find him.\"\nBenjamin nodded.

The bars in the prison were specially enforced to be anti-mage as there had been incidences of prison breaks by the mages. Benjamin tried to sense it and found out that the magical elements around the steel bars were under some sort of disturbance and they were incredibly difficult to control.

        "output": "The nobles were not happy with the increasing control of the church, which was why they retaliated. Since the church targeted the younger generation of the nobles, the nobles had no plans to let the younger generation of the church off the hook. Their way of retaliation was to destroy the most important genius of the church, the one who will most probably be the next in line as the Pope.\nOf course, one of the reasons was probably Accius’s personal vendetta against the Lithurs.\nThat was why Accius ordered this boy to seduce Grant. Although the church did not care about who Grant was sleeping with, homosexuality was still forbidden in the teachings of the church. Hence, if this was exposed, the church have no choice but to cripple itself and burn Grant to death.\nWith that, the church was effectively affected, and they could cause conflict between the church and the Lithur household, who was always loyal. Once there was a crack in their relationship, the church’s influence within the nobles would also be indirectly weakened. All in all, this was indeed a cunning method to avenge the noble’s anger.\nHowever, the church seemed to have preventative measures in place already.\nBefore all of this blew up, they found Mary, who always had the idea to let Benjamin die in Grant’s place. The two parties worked together seamlessly just like that, and the plan to substitute the ‘prince’ with a dupe was born.\nThat was really a beautiful plan.\nWithout a doubt, it was executed perfectly. Accius was completely fooled by Mary’s superb acting and mistakenly assumed Benjamin to be Grant. Accius was probably now sitting in his manor, cackling gleefully to the sky in the wrong impression that he has successfully shattered the hope of the church and settled vengeance against the Lithurs.\nHe would not even imagine that the church and Mary had already collaborated to stage this performance for him.\nBenjamin nearly laughed at the irony. This was like a battle of the heavens, where the angels had a great war. The nobles noticed the church’s Achilles’ Heel and proceeded to shoot at it in hopes to deal a critical hit. However, the church was not even worried. They simply picked up a mortal from the ground and blocked the attack.\nThat mortal was Benjamin. And the funniest thing? This was just a tiny exchange between the two. There will be another one after this, and another, and another... And the Benjamin that the church used to block the attack will soon be forgotten by everyone.\nYeah, who would remember him?\nGrant will take his identity after he was burnt to death, and use the name ‘Benjamin’ to live on discreetly until the day when he could finally stand out again. Then, everyone will sigh once again under the orders of the church and exclaim that \"Benjamin was in fact a genius!\" The nobles will not be able to use ‘Benjamin’ as a weakness of the church again.\nWhat a perfect plan!\nWho would even remember him then?\nThe person who was burnt to death on a cross in place of the future pope."

Not only that, the deafening noises disappeared like a muting spell was cast on them.\nParker was stunned. What happened?\nHe turned around to look at the square. In the center of it beside the huge crosses, a few human figures appeared suddenly.\nAfter getting distracted for a few seconds, Parker regained his attention: That appeared to be Grant Lithur! His gaze was fixed at the square. There were four people at the city square, and two of them were bound by ropes. The other two were probably Holy Knights, judging by their appearances.\nWas the execution about to start?\nFor some reason, Parker was excited. He tried to identify the legendary Grant Lithur as he looked again at the ones who were tied up. Apparently, Grant had auburn hair…... Auburn ..…. Ah, the one on the right!\nAfter he caught a clear sight on ‘Grant’ who was standing by the cross, Parker was slightly disappointed. This youth that was said to be a genius now looked dusty and unsophisticated. He looked just like an average joe.\nThis youth, so undeveloped that his pubes were not fully grown yet, was the one that was famous throughout the kingdom?\nHe took a closer look. Grant looked like he lost his soul, like a puppet in a circus; he stood unmoving, eyes half-opened, getting pushed around without resistance. Under the scrutiny of the crowd, he gave no response to the Holy Knight who were pushing him around.\nParker was very disappointed now.\nJudging from Grant’s appearance, no wonder he would do ‘that’ with another man. This boy was probably regretting his decision that caused his bright future to go into flames. That thought probably crushed his hopes, which was why he looked so miserable now, Parker guessed. Suddenly, the crowd gasped.\nWhat now? Parker’s thoughts were interrupted. He looked towards the direction where everyone was currently fixated to - the right side of the city square. An old man slowly made his way into the square.\nHe wore a papal tiara in the shade of ferrous black, the tiara surrounded with a ring of gold. Clad in a cloak of gold and red that was embroidered with intricate patterns, the old man looked dashing. At the opening of the cloak, a clean white inner was evident.\nHe wore blood red gloves, held a truncheon that was covered with pearls and diamonds. His eyes were leveled at the emptiness beyond as he stepped slowly up the highest level of the stands.\nSilent tension spread from the peak of the stands like a hot breeze across the hearts of many. The voices of the crowd were suppressed like countless bees fluttering their wings carefully, afraid to make a sound."

A few other Holy Knights appeared and started to pile firewood around the cross.\nThe pope stole a glance at ‘Grant’ who seemed to have lost his soul.

He did not get anything out of his thoughts, though.\nThe Bishop approached him and interrupted his thoughts. He whispered by the pope’s ear, \"Your Highness, the time is now. We should start.\"\nThe pope nodded once. Another cursory glance to the square showed that the area around the cross was already cleared, and there was no one aside from the two convicts with firewood around them. Thus, he stretched his arm and chanted some spells, and a small ball of fire danced in his palm. With a slight wave, the flame flew from his palm and levitated like a feather down to the crosses in the centre. All eyes immediately snapped on the flame that shone brightly like a star.\nJust as the pope left the stands, the gold flame came into contact to the pile of firewood around the cross.

That’s amazing, brother Parker, is this the pope’s divine arts?\" A knight sighed beside Parker. The knights standing guard stood in rows around the square, their faces lit with amazement after they saw what happened.\n\"Yeah, the Divine Arts. An unimaginable power.\" The flame reflected in Parker’s dark eyes as he said, \"The only thing that could stand its ground against magic is the divine arts, nothing else.\"\n\"What are you saying? Magic is not even close to fighting against the divine arts,\" Another knight butted in the conversation, \"It’s not like I haven’t fought with a mage before.

But, when he saw this sight, he felt a feeling of shock in his soul which he had never felt before.\nA Water Ball half the size of the capital, suddenly appearing on top of the capital.\nWhat did this mean?\nThe old man inhaled deeply, forcing himself to recover from his shock. However, he suddenly realized that he had subconsciously stood up and in this short period of time, broke out in cold sweat to the point the clothes on his back were soaked.\n\"The capital ... What happened this time?\"\nThe moment he uttered the words from his subconscious mind, he realized that the pub which was initially chaotic became incredibly quiet momentously.\nEveryone had put down their beer mugs, stood up and as if under the bewitchment of some type of weird magic, gathered in front of the door or window, and were gazing at the Water Ball above the capital with their breaths held, as if they were not watching the capital or Water Ball but a Holy Spirit which had taken form.\nSplashes! The dumbfounded bartender knocked a malt beer all over the floor, but that did not attract anyone’s attention.\nAt the same time, at the viewing stand on the right of the square, the Bishop stared at the enormous Water Ball in the sky and could not help but inhale deeply.

But the act of storing water balls was mechanically repeated continuously. Like this, uncountable numbers of water balls appeared in his space of consciousness and continued to pile up.\nThinking back now, he did not even know how much time passed or how many water balls were stored in the space of consciousness.\nWhen he regained consciousness again, he was already on the cross and in the pits of the flame.\nActually, strictly speaking, that could not count as regaining consciousness either. That feeling was akin to his soul leaving his body, and becoming an observer from a third person perspective, who watched the him who was bounded on the cross. He could not feel the sensation of the cross behind him, nor could he feel the heat of the flames surrounding him... The only thing he could feel was the densely packed water balls in his space of consciousness.\nWater ball...\nIn that moment, he did not think too much and subconsciously used the trick of non-verbal spell casting- he brought all of the water balls from the space of consciousness into reality.\nFor some unknown reason, during this whole process, all the water balls were oddly fused together, forming the incomparably enormous water ball that appeared above the capital.\nHe lifted his head to look at the water ball; just as if he was watching something through someone else’s eyes, he could not feel sadness or joy or a sliver of emotions.\nBut this state did not last for too long either.\nAs if a heavy hammer crashed down, his consciousness suddenly returned to his body. The flames in front of his eyes, the rising black smokes, and the crowds in the distance... He was experiencing everything as himself again- of course, and there was the Pope’s gaze from the right. That gaze watched Benjamin until he was a little irritated so he could not help but return the favor.\nBut the number of times he was conscious was only in that short moment.\nAt the blink of an eye, the weight of the entire enormous water ball crashed onto his spirit, pressuring him until he had the kind of feeling where his whole being was going to explode. He was already performing beyond his capacity by not fainting on the spot. But there was not much difference with the actual situation; not even half a second later, he already felt that he could not stand it.\nClearly, with his ability, there was no way he could maintain such an astonishing magic.\nHe could feel the collapse of magic and the loosening of his consciousness once more, but, he still scrambled to detonate the water ball in the sky before his spirit completely collapsed.\nA water ball half the size of the capital, just collapsing like that, how powerful is it?"

He used to think that he might witness this legendary magical phenomena somewhere random, like traveling through space or something to widen his experiences... but he never thought that he would see it in his own mind.\nThat’s right, within the space of consciousness, something similar to a space fissure has appeared.\nIt was a vertical fissure, with a width of not up to 10 centimeters but had a length of at least 10 meters, as if it was lightning that struck from above, Benjamin felt stunned looking at it. Within the fissure, a soft blue light was faintly peeking out. Benjamin could not help but think of the cerulean space.\nThis fissure leads to the cerulean space?\nBut judging from the way things were, Benjamin could not be glad. He did wish that he could go to the cerulean space a few more times but definitely not like this. To stay in the cerulean space, he could only do it in his spiritual form.

What made Benjamin’s heart ache and knot even more was that the water rune was gone.\nIn his space of consciousness, only two runes were left.\nFacing this sight and situation, he was not just dumbfounded anymore, Benjamin was beginning to feel horrified.\nLosing a triangular rune was not a joke!\n\"Hey, super undefeatable artificial intelligence System?

The proverb was right, impulsiveness is the devil. If he knew earlier, he would not have done this. Tell me, what benefits were there in making the water balls? Even his consciousness was blasted to this state, and he was not even sure if he could fix it…\nHuh?\nWait.\nSuddenly Benjamin snapped out of his daze and realized a problem.\nHe... was still alive?\nHe was not burnt to death by the raging flames surrounding the cross, nor was he purified by the Pope. His limbs were all there, freely moving, with not even half a sign that he was in heaven.\nThat last look from the Pope expressed it clearly- he could see that Benjamin was a mage. But now, Benjamin was still alive, unpurified by the Holy Light, which did not make sense.\nWhy?\nNo doubt, after he lost his consciousness, something unexpected must have had occurred at the execution site again.\nWhat in the world happened?\nNot only that, there was also the huge water ball he detonated; how did that impact the capital?\nThere were too many questions in Benjamin’s heart."

To avoid suspicion, your father has no way to see you.\"\nBenjamin heard that and became silent once more.\nSuddenly, with a poker face, he opened his mouth to ask, \"Do I look very sad?\"\n\"Not really sad, but more of guilt.\" He only heard Michelle say that. \"But, judging from your face that looks close to crying, yes, you look very sad.\"\nBenjamin sighed, fell back on the bed and stared blankly at the ceiling.\n\"Thank you, your words are too comforting.\"\nSensing the situation, Michelle could only shake her head, and said, \"I understand how you feel, but our situation now doesn’t allow enough time for you to frown and make a sour face.\"\nAs she was speaking, she walked to the door, held it, and then turned around to look at Benjamin and said, \"I’m going out to scout the situation.

The water particles condensed into a huge water ball. Although the water particles in the space has lessened, they heeded Benjamin’s orders and started to move. What came after was a more excruciating headache.\nBenjamin had to halt his actions that instance. He took a break and continued mobilizing the water particles to form against the tear.\nThis was what he has thought of.\nLuckily, his Space of Consciousness was not made of complicated elements - apart from his Spiritual Energy, it was the water particles. His Spiritual energy took a hit, so he would not be able to use his Spiritual Energy to heal his Spiritual Energy. If that was the case, he could take his bet on the water particles.\nUnder Benjamin’s directions, the water particles closed in on the tear and attached onto it.\nHe felt a wave of refreshing breath going through his head.\nWhen Benjamin came to, he realized that his headache had lessen a little."

It could strengthen magical runes, cast spells and even repair cuts. Benjamin suddenly felt a little regretful that he did not have an extra Water Particle crystal to hurl at the tear and speed up the recovery process.\nOf course, that would be wishful thinking.

After casting that Water Ball, his relations with the Church was now severed to the point of no return. There could only be one party standing. It wasn't wise for him to linger any longer in the Capital where the Church had a lot of influence.\nBenjamin had no choice but to bid farewell to the few months of noble life.\nHe had to leave the capital.\nOn top of that, he made the situation worse by casting the Water Ball in the middle of the city square. It’s no wonder the Church sought to closing the city gates in order to capture him.\nIt was apparent that in his current condition, it was virtually impossible for him to depend on himself to escape. Recovery from the tear was rather slow and by his estimations, it may take up to one or two months. During this period of time, he wouldn’t be able to cast any spells or the tear may widen.\nA month or two would be enough time for the Church to dig him out from the darkest corners of the Capital.\nTherefore, his only option was to ‘cooperate’ with Michelle.\nHe was in no position to second guess Michelle’s true intention.\nEven if this witch had a hidden agenda, what could he do? Benjamin’s current situation was between the devil and the deep blue sea: He would be burnt alive if he was caught by the Church or trapped and left to die by Michelle like Annie. It was death either way, he might as well naively ‘believe’ that Michelle was kindhearted enough to rescue him.

It’s not a real plague. It’s just a curse,\" Michelle looked weak but her voice was just as cold as ever. \"What we need now is a diversion. Those who are cursed will show plague symptoms. Alongside with that huge Water Ball you’ve created, the capital will be in complete turmoil. Under the public pressure, the Church would not be able to hold the borders down and we would be able to escape then.\"\nShe intentionally paused and smiled sarcastically, \"You weren’t thinking that I would spread a real plague into the city, right?\" \"...\"\nBenjamin let out a sigh of relief.\nHe knew clearly that Michelle is a person who would do anything to achieve her goals. However, she wasn’t the type who was bloodthirsty. She wouldn’t kill the whole capital and bring harm to a city of innocent people just to reach her goals.\nBenjamin had only limited understanding on curses. Commonly, curses are casted face to face. If a curse were to spread through water, it would be a hard thing to do. Unless there were a special method, otherwise the impact of the curse would lessen even if it was successfully casted.\nTo spread a curse with blood must be one of those special method. But no matter how special it was, she should not be able to cause a mass massacre, right? If that were the case, this would be a hell of spell.\nWell, if it was only going to cause the emergence of symptoms and not death, he found it acceptable.\nBut...\nThe manifestation of Michelle’s Spiritual Energy didn’t sit right with him.\nBenjamin hesitated for a while but decided to ask, \"How did your Spiritual Energy grew that strong? You weren’t like this the last time I saw you.\"\nMichelle didn’t seem to mind the query and answered, \"This was what I obtained that from the mage’s hidden treasure, including that peculiar way to cast a curse. I wouldn’t have been able to use something like that otherwise.\"\nBenjamin was stumped.\nThe mage’s hidden treasure?\nIt was that... thing that was left behind by the \"Soul’s Fire\" that he and the System looked down on and didn’t thought would amount to anything?\nBenjamin was kicking himself with regret now.\nHow could he have handed over such a great item to Michelle? If his Spiritual Energy had heightened to one similar to Michelle’s, the massive Water Ball he had unleashed would not put him in this condition. Even his Water Rune had exploded.\nSigh...\nBenjamin who was filled with regret, instantly recognised another concern."

To be able to stand against the Church, merely the strength of my Spiritual Energy would not suffice.\"\nBenjamin nodded as he thought it through.\nThat explains it...\nThe affinity of particles was most important to mages. It decided how much a Mage could control particles and it determined the strength of their magic. The Spiritual Energy was more of a supportive role.\nNevertheless, the mere increase of the Spiritual Energy was shocking enough.\nAfter all, it wasn’t just an up skill of a point or two, it had multiplied in ten to twenty times in strength.\nIt really was... unbelievably powerful.\nBenjamin still had a lot of questions unanswered. It was a shame that Michelle returned to blabbering nonsense in return. Benjamin couldn’t proceed with his enquiries any further.\nBenjamin had to give up.\nThere wasn’t any point of badgering if the other party refused to speak.\nFrom the looks of things, Michelle seemed to be genuinely wanting to help him escape the capital. If that was the case, he did not want to nitpick on her actions.\nAs long as he made it through a month or two, he would be able to fill up the crack in his Space of Consciousness. Once he has gotten his powers back, no matter what tricks Michelle pulled, he wouldn’t be afraid anymore.\nAnd before that, Michelle could just do whatever she pleases. It was out of his hands.\nAfter casting the curse, Michelle was wary enough to eliminate traces of their existence left behind. She then led Benjamin out of the abandoned yard and into a hideaway where it would become their new hidden base.\nDuring the process, Benjamin returned again to his Space of Consciousness and continued with the repairs.\nHe did not notice that at the moment of departure, Michelle’s face started to reveal a sinister expression. With that, the days of their hide and seek began.\nIt would require time to fertilise Michelle’s intended chaos. During this time, they could only change bases to avoid detection.\nBenjamin had also been trying to hatch a plan to learn more about the Lithur household. Oddly enough, the Church had only launched an investigation against the household and that was all. The family was still living comfortably at home and was not captured under the charge of conspiring with a Mage.\nBenjamin did not quite understand this but it did put him at ease to focus the problems at hand.\nHe wasn’t in the best position. They had moved to over ten locations in a span of seven days to avoid the Church’s arrest.\nMost of the moving was done during the night. There were other circumstances whereby they would disguise as ordinary citizens and blend in the crowd during the day as they traveled to their next destination."

The hikers who tried and failed would say that they had tried their best and could never peek the cloud penetrating peak no matter how high they climbed.\nThat was why, the mountain range was named \"Sky\", as the sky was the limit, literally.\nBenjamin did not think that they would be able to cross the Sky Mountain Range. So that would be a dead end for heading towards North. The South area would not even be worth considering. The South of the Kingdom was a vast ocean. The mainland inhabitants did not have much interest in the ocean, and there never lived an explorer like Columbus. So, if there was anything in the ocean, no one knew.\nEven if the East of the Kingdom was the Valley of Broken Armies towered with the Crusader Gateway; across those gates was the Kingdom of Icor — the Kingdom that rejected the Church and opened their arms to mages and was built by the queen eight years ago."

To Benjamin, it seemed that this would be his current best option.\nSo when Michelle chose the North gate as their escape route, he was puzzled.\nNorth Gate? What was there? Even if this was a diversion tactic, it should not work this way. If it was to cloud the Church’s judgment, it would not be worth the time as each gate would be guarded by men anyway.\nThere must be another explanation for Michelle’s action.\n\"The senior mage’s hidden treasure includes this underground stone path.\" Michelle threw a map towards Benjamin. \"The stone path is long but the senior has already investigated and there is no danger. As long as we could get through the path, we will be able to reach a cave nearby the Valley of Broken Armies through the Perseus Lake.\"\nUnderground stone path?\nBenjamin raised his eyebrows upon hearing the news.\nHe grabbed the map and took a look. The map was an ordinary map of the Kingdom. The only difference was that there was an additional line towards the North East. One end of the line was the Perseus Lake in the North while the other was close to the Kingdom’s border frontier. Both ends of the line were marked with the detailed locations of the entrances and exits.\nThis should be the underground stone path that Michelle was talking about.\nThere was such an extraordinary terrain within the Kingdom? He wondered if it was natural or man made.\nBenjamin was not sceptical on exiting through the North Gates after learning of this. The stone path would be safer than fleeing on land. It would confuse the Church in case the troops were camped out at the Crusader Gateway to prevent their journey out of the Kingdom.\nHe had the System to record the details on the map. He then started his preparation to escape by working on his disguise to blend in the crowd.\nThey took around an hour to complete the camouflage. Michelle obviously had the upper hand, showcasing skills that was eye opening to Benjamin. She dyed her hair red after cutting it short, used glue to stick her lids together imitating squinty eyes, a special dye to create freckles on her nose, as well as knocked off one of her front teeth... The final result was as though she was a different person.\nBenjamin could not help but marvelled in amazement. With these skills, she needed not be a mage, she could be a special effect makeup artist back in his original world.\nMichelle did a complete makeover for Benjamin. She gave him an odd herb which quickly turned his skin pale white and his hair colour took a lighter shade like an albino. His healthy tan that resulted from military training was nowhere to be traced."

Mount North should now just be an empty and abandoned mountain.\nOf course, they did not plan to hide there. If they went there, they had to stray further off course, and that could lead to more unpleasant possibilities. They just wanted to borrow the geographical advantage it provided to escape from the Church. After that they could slowly make their way to Pearl Valley.\nUsing the underground pass, reaching the Valley of Broken Armies, then escaping the Kingdom of Helius was their real motive.\nTime passed slowly, and the capital was left further and further behind. On the way, everything was peaceful. They did not have any encounters and eventually sense of impending danger slowly faded. Benjamin even entered his dimension of consciousness to continue working on repairs of the rift.\nSlowly, time passed into the afternoon, the light in the sky slowly dimmed, and the surrounding trees had their shadows lengthened.\nAfter spending some time doing the repairs, Benjamin felt mentally exhausted and left his dimension of consciousness, ready to rest.\nOn the carriage, he looked at the surroundings which was totally foreign to him. Suddenly, he turned around and looked at Michelle."

Benjamin did not know why Michelle saved him, who she really was, and what she was actually capable of.\nHe only knew that Michelle was once a holy knight who became a mage. The holy knights would not just accept any woman, but she made them accept her; the holy knights would not allow anyone to retire, but she did it.\nMichelle probably had a lot of stories, but if she did not want to share it, there was nothing Benjamin could do.\nHowever, there was no explanation for this, but he felt that upon seeing Michelle this time, she seemed different from before. It was not just her increase in mental energy, he could feel that Michelle’s sharp, gloomy aura was gone, and it was easy to talk to her now.\nBut this did not make Benjamin feel safe, it made him feel that something was wrong instead.\nWho knew what happened in the ruins that was left behind by the \"Soul’s Fire\".\n\"Let’s stop for a while, the horses are tired, I’ll feed them something.\" Suddenly, Michelle spoke.\nBenjamin was stunned for a while, but took a hold of the reins and stopped the carriage.\nHe did not have any skill of riding. But the previous Benjamin seemed to have learned how to ride a horse before as the System managed to dig out that part of the memory. Under the guidance of the System, even though he did not know how to make the carriage turn, he could still manage to stop it.\nAfter stopping, Michelle took out some grains and water, and went down to feed the horses.\nBenjamin turned behind and gazed towards the capital.\nThe road they took to come here was empty and looked desolate under the afternoon. In his sight, the capital was just a tiny white block. It was too far to see if there was any troops chasing them.\nRight now, Michelle’s plan to spread the \"plague\" and escape the capital was still successful. Other than the holy knights who were behaving strangely, everything was going according to plan. Blending into the crowd, leaving the capital, stealing a horse carriage, and go as far away as possible... No accidents have occurred.\nThis made Benjamin feel calm, but he still had tiny pangs of anxiety.\nCould ... the Church have given up pursuing them?\nIf it was really like this, he would no longer need to feel anxious. What he was afraid of was that the Church had more tricks up their sleeves, and all of this was just a period of calm before the storm.\nWas it really like this?\nHe never thought that his ability to jinx something would be activated right there.\nAfter Michelle fed the horses, she leaned onto the floor again to listen for sounds of galloping horses. The moment she put her ears on the floor, her calm demeanor vanished.\nShe seemed to have discovered something strange, after ten seconds, she immediately stood up, jumped back onto the carriage and lifted to whip to start the carriage."

If it was only half of the talent he had, it was enough to make her reach a higher level of magical skills, maybe... maybe it was enough to annihilate the Church already.\nSadly, after throwing away the halo the Church gave her for unknown reasons, she became just a normal mage.\nOrdinary to the point that even if she did all she could ever hope to do, she would only become a stepping stone for those \"geniuses\".\nWhich was exactly what she was doing right now.\nHow could she not hate Benjamin Lithur? She started to regret, why did she shove him off with her arms instead of kicking him.\nHopefully that kid will cause more trouble for the Church.\nThinking of this, Michelle turned around and looked at the troops behind her.\nAfter being delayed by Michelle’s \"left arm\" for a while, they have regained distance, and was closer. At this moment, they were nearly close enough to launch an attack. The thirty plus Cleaners all raised their longswords. The surrounding holy light reacted to their summoning and gathered together.\nSeeing this, Michelle nodded.\nThis distance was almost enough.\nShe has led them far enough already, there was no point in continuing. She could not continue to remain in this horse carriage. Otherwise, when the giant holy light sword slices down, she has no idea what would happen at the current state she was in.\nThus, with the final whipping, Michelle readied herself and jumped off the horse carriage. She rolled a few times on the ground and stood up. She stabilized herself and stood in the way of the Cleaners and the bishop.\nWith this, the horse carriage behind her sped off at an even greater speed.\nThe troops chasing her all held their reins and stopped in their tracks."

Just as they were about to ride the horse and race towards the direction where the carriage disappeared, another Holy Knight on a horse appeared behind them from the turn of the mountain range.\n\"Sir! I, I have a very important message to convey to you!\"\nA terrified voice halted the platoons that were about to make a move.\nYet another change in the situation.\nThe Bishop pulled the rein and turned to look coldly at the Holy Knight who rushed in with his horse.\n\"What’s going on?\" The Holy Knight stopped his horse before he glanced at the Bishop and the remaining Cleaners. He seemed to be nervous under the scrutiny of so many people; he stuttered as he tried to speak.\n\"It’s….. It’s…..\" He took a deep breath and cleared his throat before he finally continued, \"It’s His Highness the Pope.\"\nThe color drained from the Bishop’s face.\nHowever, he quickly schooled his expression and remained neutral, his eyes twinkling discreetly underneath his lashes.\n\"His Highness…. His Highness went to the other direction. We decided to capture Benjamin Lithur from two directions,\" the Holy Knight uttered as his voice was calming down but his undulating emotions were cut away mercilessly like weeds in a garden by the Bishop, \"But if His Highness did find something, why would you be the one who came to pass the message?\"\nThe Bishop’s words shifted the atmosphere. The Cleaners’ gazes gradually turned hostile as they were examining the messenger Holy Knight. Some even had their hands rest on the hilt of their swords.\nThe messenger Holy Knight paused before explaining hastily, \"No sir, for some reason, all of the God’s Eyes are malfunctioned. There was no choice but to send me to pass the news.\"\nMost of the Cleaners’ seemed rather perplexed upon hearing this; as if they were doubting the credibility of this holy knight.\nThe Bishop, on the other hand, did not speak. He took out a silver bead that was emanating divine waves from his pocket to verify the Holy Knight’s statement.\nHe held the bead in his hands and focused his gaze on it, as if he was investigating if the God’s Eye was still functioning as a medium of contact. Soon, the bishop furrowed his brows and looked slightly confused. He kept the silver sphere quietly."

In an instant, his facial expression abruptly changed, as if he suddenly discovered something.

There was no one at the open fields near Perseus Lake, just north to the kingdom.\nThe situation was not like this just half an hour ago. At that time, the Pope stopped here, clad in a cloak and holding the scepter. His lidded eyes were slightly raised as he looked in shock at the person before him who blocked his way.\nThe person opposite him was also an elderly.

I have already banned anyone from the Lithur household from leaving the kingdom.\"\nThe old madame looked at the sky, seemingly clueless. She then said with a smile, \"Oh, really? I’m sorry, my memory doesn’t work like it used to be anymore. I’m old and weary now, and I hope you wouldn’t mind, Your Highness.\" She did not do anything after her apologies, though. Instead, she stood with her back straight and stared at the Pope with an innocent twinkle in her eyes.\nThe Pope frowned. It was evident from his tightening grip on the scepter that he felt that something was off. The madame just stood primly in the middle of this empty field, and the Pope felt an immense pressure on his chest.\nIt was ages ago when he last felt this much of pressure.\nAfter some thoughts, he nodded without expression and said, \"Ah, if that’s the matter, I will understand your actions, Madame Lithur. God is merciful, and you can now return to the kingdom.\"\nHowever, the madame did not reply nor have any intention to leave.

A sense of hopelessness flooded him.\nThus, he could only watch on as the fire in his chest moving about elegantly before switching colors. Red, yellow, blue, purple…... Gradually, it became transparent, as if it disappeared into thin air. However, he knew clearly that it did not disappear; instead, it was transforming, as if it had a life of its own.\nThe madame nodded in approval when she saw how the fire was faring. \"Hmm, I should really get going before I lose my memories completely. I should really start hiding before I become an idiot again,\" She said and bowed to the Pope with a friendly smile, \"I’ll take my leave, Your Highness, good luck.\"\nIn between her words, she made a gesture of prayer and said with her palms held together, \"May your God be with you.\"\nThen, she turned and wobbled forward like a harmless old lady who could not even walk stably, and left.\nThe Pope did not manage to witness her departure, though.\nWell, it should be said that after the madame turned and left, the fire in his chest suddenly grew much stronger and pulled the Pope in. In a blink of an eye, there was no one left at the place where the Pope once stood; not even ashes were left.\nThe field became empty. Only the discarded scepter could be the proof of this extraordinary encounter, and even that would be a stretch.\nAt the same time, in the depths of St. Peter’s Cathedral, there was a very well-hidden chamber beneath the Silent Room, right at the end of a long corridor. The chamber was small, and in it was was only something akin to a coffin. The chamber was dim, and it was seen that the coffin was not covered. In it lied an old man with his eyes shut, and he had a shocking resemblance to the Pope.\nWith a shocked, sharp inhale, the person in the coffin snapped his eyes open and shot upright.\n\"Hah…... I…... No! How could this be?\"\nAfter a rushed exchange of breaths, he quickly looked down to his chest. Like a spirit, the crimson flame once again danced around his heart and started the color-changing process. A deep despair lit the depth of his eyes."

He guessed that these were the people who found him after he rolled off the hill, and they were the ones that brought him here. Still, this could not stop him from feeling dumbfounded.\nWho were they? Where was he? Why did they bring him here? He got to get all the facts down.\n\"Um, nice to meet you.

By any chance, do you have any information with what’s happening outside?\"\n\"Yeah!\" The girl who broke into a tearful smile now cheered as she answered, \"It’s raining now, there’s mud everywhere, and if you go out your clothes will get dirty.\" \"...\"\nWho the f*ck said the world was wonderful?\nAfter about half an hour of very difficult communication, Benjamin finally had a cursory understanding about these three people. The man was Howl, and according to him, he was a bandit in Mount North. When the Church raided the bandits that year, he hid under a pile of horse manure in fear and escaped. He was the only survivor aside from their leader. He crawled out of the manure after the raid was done, escaped the mountains and met these girls at the foothills.\nThese girls were sisters, and the fiercer one was the older sister, Nina, and she was 10 years old. The shy one was the younger sister, Sandy. According to Nina, they came from a troupe from the South, and Nina was furious when she found out that the troupe leader had been sexually harassing Sandy. Hence, she poured half a bottle of glue down his underwear when the leader was asleep before she escaped the troupe with her sister.\nThey performed on their journey to survive before they stumbled into this place and met the cowardly bandit Howl who was just running down the hill. Thus, the three of them met like old friends, and somehow they decided to find a place to stay and lived happily for a whole year. \"That’s great! There’s still hope in humanity, love and compassion still exist,\" The System sobbed dramatically in his mind.\nThat was not what Benjamin expected to hear, but his eyes still lit up excitedly when he heard that.\nFortunately these three were not entirely isolated from the world even though they lived in a remote place; they knew what they should know. In that case, Benjamin could probably get quite a lot of information from them. He was worried that he would meet those who lived in seclusion and had no idea what happened outside of their lives. Benjamin would never get anything useful then.\n\"I know about all that. What I want to know is, what happened after the kingdom opened their gates?\" Benjamin asked immediately."

He could not do anything but to cast this aside and wait for the three to ‘get news from the nearest village’ before going through his thought process again.\nAccording to the description provided by the System, this hut was so remote that the Church would need some time before they could find it. There should not be problems for him to stay here for a few days, and he would not cause problems to the three either.\nEven though Benjamin could not fathom their reasons for saving him, he was still grateful for their help.\nBenjamin faced the three people and said, \"Um….

They urged Benjamin to get out of bed and follow them out of the hut. Outside was a small valley, and when they walked further down the valley, Benjamin saw a small field full of potatoes. It was surrounded with a simple wooden fence, and in the middle stood a horrendously weaved scarecrow. The fence surrounding the field seemed damaged, as if it was caused by wild animals.\nThe scarecrow was Harry.\nAfter he heard Nina’s introduction, it did not take Benjamin long to catch on the reason why these people rescued him.\nThey just needed a coolie.\n\"Harry is here alone everyday, can you keep him company?

Finally, he chewed on the food without uttering a word.\nAfter the short episode during lunchtime, Benjamin continued hustling, and nothing much happened. The whole afternoon was spent mending the rift, and time past quickly as night arrived within a blink of the eye. Ex-bandit Howl who went to the nearby village to shop was finally back home. He came back with two pieces of information for Benjamin.\nThe first one said that something big happened yesterday regarding the plague in the kingdom. Apparently, the thirty thousand people who caught the plague died at the same time yesterday. The whole kingdom was dumbfounded, but the Church’s response was swift. They gave posthumous benefits to the families of the deceased, and said that these thirty thousand died gloriously in the battle with the mages, and declared that they terminated the mage who spread the ‘plague’. None of this would happen in the future, and everyone in the kingdom need not worry.\nThus, even though there was still unrest within the kingdom and people still fled the kingdom, there was no major uproar as most of them were already compensated.\nBenjamin could not be bothered on whether there was a riot against the Church - he was shocked enough when he was told that thirty thousand people perished. He remembered clearly that Michelle told him that this curse was not fatal when she first planted it. It was not like he totally believed Michelle’s words, he just did not think that Michelle could really do something like this.\nHell, this was considered sociopathic behavior! Benjamin felt slightly traumatized by that information and could not stop gasping. He thought this message was shocking enough, but he still was stunned when he heard ‘the mage who spread the plague was terminated’.\nThe moment he heard of Michelle’s passing, his emotions became complicated. This indirectly confirmed his earlier suspicion - that Michelle sacrificed herself to save him. But why?\nHe found it hard to believe.\nIt was not as though he did not think the Church was lying. The Church may not have caught her and leaked this information in order to calm the people. However, Howl revealed more details as he pressed on.\n\"The Church’s bulletin explained that the spread of the plague wasn’t done by a living Mage, but rather a soul manifested by a dead Mage named Michelle. The way this soul was formed was very unique and wouldn’t last long. The Church has completely extinguished it and started establishing a cleansing cross to purify the water source so no one can spread any disease through the water source.\"\nBenjamin was stunned for a while after hearing this.\nThe mention of \"Michelle\" is a confirmation that the Church has indeed captured Michelle or they would have thought Michelle has escaped abroad and not tied her to the plague.\nThe \"Soul\" he said earlier, what does it mean?\n... Could it be that Michelle had already passed on before this?"

He even thought that the Church may be spitting nonsenses but if you could think about it, there was no need for the Church to make such a move. It did not matter to the people whether it was a Mage or a Mage’s Soul who spread the plague. The Church must have told it like it was, there was no need for frills.\nI guess... This had to be real.\nMichelle had died somewhere out there and became a Soul. She returned to the capital, saved him and evidently sacrificed her bodily soul in order to lure the Church away from him.\nHe felt there was a mountain of pressure on his chest - stuffy and oppressed that he could not take another breath.\nFrom the moment Michelle appeared, Benjamin had a slight suspicion. He felt there was no logic to the way Michelle handled things and her personality was a little different. But no matter how he wrapped his brain around it, he would not have thought that Michelle had died and the person who escaped to the capital with him was only her Soul.\nTruth be told, this world was not one where souls haunted. Souls only existed within legends and myths. There were not many who have heard of others seeing living souls. Therefore, death was merely death, even if the soul was willing to stay, it was nearly impossible.\nUnless, the person who passed had a strong urge to live…\nHe gripped his knuckles as he thought about this. His feelings were mixed, as though he drank a bitter wine.\nHe remembered when he was shoved down the horse carriage. Michelle became overly emotional, talking to him about the \"inability to move on\". Benjamin had never seen Michelle in such an overly emotional state. Her hatred towards the Church was like blood spewed from the arteries and drenched the whole capital.\nShe hated the Church to this extent.\nBenjamin suddenly realized that he could understand this feeling a little more.\n\"As long as you’re still a Mage and the Church still existed then...\" He subconsciously recalled the words of Michelle.\n\"What did you say?\" Still in reality, Howl was standing aside clenching on his bread. He did not quite make out what Benjamin said, so he scrounged his face to ask.\nBenjamin quickly came to and shook his head, \"Nothing, it’s just that... an acquaintance has passed.\"\nEven now he could not think of a word to describe Michelle. Their relationship was overly complicated. Companions, enemies, calculative, sacrifice... He thought of it, and the only thing that blurted out of his mouth was ‘acquaintance’.\nA very shallow yet twisted definition.\nIf someone was to hear this, they would probably be confused.

What if he were to meet with any accidents on the road or make one wrong move? Then all the planning would be in vain.\nJust like the situation now, after around five days on foot, Benjamin followed the System’s direction and made it to a village near the Perseus Lake.

There were also all kinds of faces in the crowd and you could see there was no lack of rich people around. It did not look as though it fit the \"village\" profile.\nAnd that was why he asked the System that very question.\nThe System replied in all certainty, \"This is the best route to take after going through data compilation of over a thousand maps, artificial intelligence automatic positioning and sophisticated system calculation.

That would explain the population.\nBenjamin raised his head and scrounged his face at the thought of this.\nIt was evening time as the daylight turned dim. If he were to pass the village and be on his way, the possibility of him being attacked by wild animals would be high. Moreover, the dry food that Nina packed him had already finished. He was already out of food supplies making his way here.\nWhat if there was nothing in the underground passageway and it just an endless long road? If he only required water, he could bear that cracking headache to summon fine ice pieces to quench his thirst.

He took a glance at the man’s odd expression and could not help but feel something was out of place.\nDid he speak too much?\n\"Cough... about that,\" the man cleared his throat. \"Do you have anything to eat?\"\nDick was stunned.\n... Huh?\nHis original plan was simple. The Fulners had unimaginable wealth. Apart from the Church, no one was richer than them in the whole Kingdom. Although Benjamin did not understand why the eldest son of the Fulner family ended up in a tiny village, but surely his net worth was still among the top.\nThat was why when Benjamin spotted Dick, he instantly saw the solution to his food problem."

Or else, he really would not have even an ounce of power to fight.\nFor many reasons, Benjamin walked quite cautiously and not very quickly. Just like this, about 15 minutes passed with no particular incident, he arrived at a chamber-like place.\nThe space here was extraordinarily vast, as if it was a large underground square. The moss on the walls had also lessened but when he lifted his head to look above, those glowing moss filled the rocky walls of the ceiling with a density never seen before. On the vast rocky walls on top of his head, the blue-green colored patches assembled to become beams of luminous arcs that twinkled in reflection. In a state of daze, he even thought that he saw a starry sky.\nAfter taking a deep breath, Benjamin recovered from the shock and continued looking ahead.\nThen, in the middle of this chamber, he saw a rock that radiated a fiery red light.\n\"That is…\"\nBenjamin could not help but frown.\nIn this extraordinarily spacious chamber, apart from the red gemstone, there was nothing else. No erected stalagmites, no drooping stalactites, the ground was flat and smooth, the ceiling neat and orderly… everything here betrayed strong clues that they were man-made, and were completely unlike a naturally-formed cave.\nAs for the gem, it was placed directly at the center of the whole chamber. It was positioned perfectly, clearly placed there on purpose by somebody.\nWhat does this mean?\nBenjamin knew too that this was where \"Soul’s Fire\" left behind his treasure. The red gemstone was similar to a fire elemental crystal, but did not feel quite the same. It could very well be an item that senior mage left behind.\nBut…Michelle was probably here before, right.\nThe treasure of \"Soul’s Fire\", was something always on her heart. Although Benjamin was not sure how Michelle died, but when her dying soul unleashed the curse, it already mentioned that she had obtained the treasure.\nThen what could this odd red gemstone be?\nOn that thought, Benjamin took a look around again. What was weird was that apart from the path he came in, he could not see any other exit from this chamber.\nThis is a dead end?\nNo way….\nAfter thinking for a while, Benjamin surmised that the problem probably still lied with that piece of red gemstone. So he walked closer, approached it, took two glances, but he still could not see anything special about it. He only felt a warm sensation in his body."

After all, a fine living person would not just fall dead; there must be a reason.\nFor some unknown reason, after coming here, he suddenly felt that Michelle’s death had something to do with this.\nAnd so he could not help but be more cautious in his actions.\nHe circled the red gemstone for 2 rounds and could not discover anything. Then he turned around suddenly and began walking in circles around the chamber while borrowing the faint luminous light from above his head to observe all possibilities around him.\nIt felt like he was playing an escape game where he was mysteriously locked in a room, and had to randomly flip things over and search, finally exhausting all ideas to compile certain number of digits for a password.\nHowever, an escape room game at least gave hints and he would know how many digits the password he had to crack had. But this chamber in front of his eyes was seriously barren; except for the mosses above his head, there was the red gemstone at the center. Apart from those, everything was spick and span to the point of abnormality.\nHe could not be expected to investigate the color distribution of the moss and crack the hidden code, can he?\nSpending almost a whole hour, he finished searching through the whole chamber. After a futile search, he could only return to the side of the red gem.\nAfter thinking for a while, he stretched out his hand and picked up the gem.\nNothing happened.\nBenjamin felt a bit odd. He assumed that this piece of gem held some sort of contraption, and picking it up would make the chamber collapse or open a door. In the end, he held this thing in his hand, flinging it left and right, and nothing has happened in the chamber.\n\"Hey, you take a look, isn’t this thing a little weird?\" So, he said to the System.\nUnexpectedly, the usually chatty System made no response in that instance. Benjamin’s mind was a piece of silence, so silent that it was strange.\nHe suddenly felt a little creeped out.\nWhat was the situation?\n\"Did your battery die? If you’re not dead do come out and say something, stop taking your time.\" And so, he nagged again in his heart.\n\"Warning! Warning! \" Finally, the System’s voice rang out, but the robotic tone was as different from the usual as the sky and land, \"Fire particle was found to be abnormal, please stay away immediately from the high-risk object, or else your life would be in danger!\"\n...The fire particle is abnormal?\nHearing that, Benjamin was bewildered and looked towards the red gemstone in his hand.\nHonestly speaking, just holding the thing in his hand like that, he could not feel any abnormalities. At most he felt the warm, fuzzy feeling in his body, a sensation that did not feel lethal."

Until now only did it gradually slow down, no longer rolling.\nAfter some thought, Benjamin walked over and picked it up.\n\"This thing ... flew out of the fissure?\" He frowned and asked.\n\"Mhmm, just like that.\" The System recovered and replied, \"After the explosion occurred in the fissure, and shortly thereafter, this blue bead flew out from the fissure. Eight or nine out of ten of this was blasted out from the red gemstone.\"\nBlasted out?\nBenjamin could not help raising his eyebrows in surprise.\nHe attentively scrutinized the round bead- it weighed very little; had cold surface and a hard texture. Color-wise, it was not purely blue, and instead had two color tones. The inside layer was the same shade of blue as the Pure Blue Space, while the outside layer was transparent.\nJudging from the color on the inside layer, this was most probably something that came from that Pure Blue World. Since it originated from that world, then this item was probably quite something.\nHow should he use it?\nBenjamin used his damaged spiritual energy to feel it, but he could only feel water vapor blown in his face and a simple, faint breath of life. He felt that this stuff was probably formed by water particles, but was different from water elemental crystals; there was something else in its composition and it had a unique internal structure.\n\"My spiritual energy isn’t really working right now; I can’t really feel much from it.\" Suddenly, Benjamin said to the System, \"You can detect elemental crystal’s oscillations, right? You try detecting what in the world is this thing for.\"\n\"So much work ... I’ll try I guess.\" The System seemed reluctant, but still agreed.\nUnexpectedly, the moment the System’s voice fell, in less than two seconds, the internal blue layer of the bead suddenly shone, just like an unlit light bulb which was suddenly connected to electricity.\nThis …..\nNot only that, Benjamin suddenly felt weight disappearing from his hand; it was like the whole bead lost its weight, even the hard, transparent outer layer softened up. Then, as if influenced by some buoyancy force, the bead actually started slowly floating by itself.\nIt floated approximately to the level of Benjamin’s head and stopped. However, it did not hover like the other magic runes. It was like an air bubble in the water, gently floating according to the water particles in the air.\nThat feeling, it was like ... it had life.\n\"Hey, what kind of situation is this?\" Benjamin hurriedly asked the System.\n\"I…I don’t know either.\" The System answered, a little panicked.\nBenjamin was astonished upon hearing the System’s repose."

Yes.\"\n\"What will you become? A fish? Or a tadpole? Jellyfish? Squid?\"\n\"I don’t know …...\"\n\"When will you be hatched?\"\n\"I want to know too.\"\n\"...\"\nHe asked quite a number of questions but Benjamin’s curiosity was still unsatisfied.\nHe still had too many sought after answers regarding the weird \"fish egg\".

Could it be, all these glowing mosses were under the influence of the red gemstone? Once the red gemstone disappeared, they would wither immediately?\nBenjamin did not have time to do anything and soon enough, all the mosses withered in masses; even a leftover dot of light had vanished. He was trapped in darkness.\nAt the same time, a wave of dizziness struck him. He felt a little odd, closed his eyes and rubbed his temples. Fortunately, the dizziness went away quickly. However, when he opened his eyes once more, he was dumbfounded again.\nThe chamber in front of him had changed again.\nIt was not just plain darkness anymore; faint light came from a cave opening in front of him, which also allowed one to barely see one’s surroundings. But the extraordinary part of this matter was that during Benjamin’s previous investigation of his surrounding, there was no hole like the one in front of him, nor was there any form of light from the cave opening in front of him.\nAn extra hole just appearing out of thin air- how could he not be surprised?\nA trap?

It was merely silently sprawled over there, looking like it had been there for quite some time.\nSo, Benjamin could not help walking over to take a closer look but did not expect to find the corpse the more familiar the more he looked at it. From its parched face and facial features, he could even identify the corpse.\nThis was Michelle’s body. \"... Damn.\" Upon realising this, Benjamin could not hold his shocked expression.\nHe had known of the news of Michelle’s death, but what he had never imagined was that she died here.\nBut …...\nAs he was recovering from the shock, Benjamin realised that everything made sense now.\nMost probably after entering the treasure spot, Michelle saw the red gemstone and thought the red gemstone was the treasure \"Soul’s Fire\" left behind and thus, picked it up. But the result was as Benjamin’s experienced earlier, her whole body bled which could not be stopped. Sadly, she did not possess such ability like the Space of Consciousness, and so, she bled to death.\nAnd the blood she bled with the help of the red gemstone or some other factors, formed the cursed soul figure he saw later.\nAfter figuring all this out, Benjamin could not help but sigh deeply.\nFrom another point of view, Michelle could be seen a formidable hero. She had a great ambition and also elaborate plans. In order to execute her plans, she handled things one at a time, exhausting all types of ideas by hook or by crook, but in the end, she lost to a small piece of red gemstone.\nBenjamin helplessly shook his head a little.\nShe had died; thinking about all this was useless. He just suddenly felt that he should give Michelle a proper burial. Whether it be burying her or cremating her, at the end of the day, he could not just leave her corpse here like this, rotting away alone.\n----- She did sacrifice herself for him after all.\nWithin this whole chamber, most parts of the ground were hard rocks and could not be penetrated. But, at some corner of the side, Benjamin managed to find soil. And so, he spent almost more than an hour digging, using a wooden bucket as a tool, and managed to dig out a small pit.\nHe placed Michelle’s corpse in the pit and covered it up with soil; he considered that a burial for Michelle.

Thus, Benjamin reckoned that apart from emitting light, these mosses could also induce hallucinations.\nThe hallucinations obstructed Benjamin’s sight, making him unable to detect these things.\nThis probably was a trap set down by that \"Soul’s Fire\" here.\nThe mosses relied on the red gemstone to live and at the same time, lured those who enter here into hallucinations.

Soon enough, a river appeared before Benjamin.\n--- This was already a magnificent subterranean view, not to mention that this river was shining.\nAt first, Benjamin thought it was the river water which was unique. But upon scrutiny, he instead discovered that the river was full of a type of tadpole-like living thing. They had a translucent body and gave off a soft, white glow. It was this white glow that they were emitting together which gave an illusion of the river glowing, as if it was a gleaming, swerving, subterranean Milky Way.\nBenjamin watched with amazement.\nWhat could this be?

Only someone so powerful to the extent of feeling bored that could live so wantonly and treat life as a game.\nAlso, what a pity that Michelle persistently chased after the treasure, but things turned out to be this way. He was not sure if her dead soul saw this passage. If she did, how downcast would she feel?\nBenjamin, thinking along those lines, skimmed the paragraph two more times. But, he suddenly discovered that to the upper corner of these engraved words, there were also some smaller words stuck closely together.\nThe smaller words were not engraved and instead used some sort of …... material which looked like blood or something of that sort to write with. The time of writing probably was not long ago but it had almost completely fallen off. Benjamin had to go closer, and look at them extra attentively to manage to see them clearly.\nObviously, the smaller words were not left by \"Soul’s Fire\", but by someone else who had been here before and was left as a comment to this paragraph.\nBenjamin broke into laughter. The moment he saw this sentence, he could imagine that scene -----Michelle’s poor soul upon seeing this particular sentence, and showing an expression of rage and disbelief, and would probably start cussing.

Following this tunnel, he could reach the Valley of Broken Armies at the east of the kingdom. He could completely escape the Church and slip out of the kingdom. This escape route would it be enough, was it not?\nIn reality, an underground cavern that stretched this far was a miracle itself.

The explosion previously did not create much impact to the rift. The rift gradually became smaller as he was about to reach the end of his journey.

It was like the clouds cleared off to make way for a blue sky. He felt refreshed; his endocrine system returned to normal.\nAt last, he could cast magic once more without having to worry!\nEven though the rune that exploded had not returned yet, but at least he had two other spells.

He then set off for the nearest town from here.\nEven if the System did not remind him, he already memorized the geography of this area in the map very well.\nThe town closest to here was the border town of Crewe, which was at the most eastern part of the kingdom.\nIt existed because of the Crusader Gateway and the Valley of Broken Armies. Whether it was traders, or those priests on a mission, they would all stop at Crewe. After some time the economy at the town progressed into a well-to-do state. It can be said that Crewe was one of the must go to places for a person going abroad, or those leaving or entering the kingdom. All of them could not avoid this place. Benjamin was starving; it was time for him to properly nourish himself.\nHe was not worried about being on the wanted list of the Church. Even though his albino disguise had faded a lot, but after being in the underground pass for half a month, his hair had grown a lot; his clothing was tattered; his face was gritty and grimy; his eyes were circled with dark spots from the lack of sleep. He was very much like a barbarian.\nIf anyone were to recognize him now, that person would be way too skilled.\nCrewe was a few kilometers away from the cave. Benjamin first used the Pillar of Steam to fly for a while. When he was getting close to the town, he started walking instead and very soon entered the village.\nIt was a refreshing experience for Benjamin to see a human face after being isolated for half a month.\n----He seemed to have really turned into a barbarian.\nBeing a border town, Benjamin thought that the denizens would be very uneducated and rough; all of them would be armed with a longsword as they walked around, and would easily get provoked to get into fights. However after arriving at the town, he found out that it gave off a relaxed feeling.\n\"Hey man, wanna try one of our black buns? Every traveller would buy one for defense, it has been said that someone killed a gray bear with it!\" \"...\"\nDespite what he said was laughable, the young man that pushed around the cart to sell things, did not reveal any uneasy expression when faced with a barbarian.

I’ll take one then.\"\nThe sack of gold coins he snatched from Dick could definitely afford him to purchase not just one bread; he could buy the whole cart if he wanted. In fact he was hungry.

He took his luggage and acted like a travelling merchant, and set off towards the Crusader Gateway which was east of the small town.\nHe was prepared to cross the border of the Kingdom of Helius.\n\"....\" The Crusader Gateway was not far from the town of Crewe, it should be said that the two are joined. If you walk east along the road from Crewe, you can see a gate that is about seventy meters tall, standing majestically like a tree above everyone’s heads.\nThis was Benjamin’s first time seeing such a majestic structure.\nIn his previous life, the concrete buildings were tall, but maybe because they were overly sophisticated, it did not feel special at all to be there. But a gate like this Crusader Gateway, even though the architecture was simple and was only about seven to eight floors tall, it looked like an endless white wall in the shape of a mountain. It gave off an ancient and opulent feel. Even if he just stood at the side to view it, it felt like he would never be able to pass through it.\nThe gate was a thousand meters wide, and few hundred meters thick. It was placed at the entrance to the Valley of Broken Armies. The exchange point for the kingdom and Icor was in the middle of a mountainous area, and could only be accessed from this valley. Thus, the Valley of Broken Armies had strategic value.\nBefore he came here, Benjamin had thought of how he could pass the customs check. Even though the kingdom was not closed to the outside world, they were strict at the customs.\nThus he even properly disguised himself to make sure no one would recognize him as the wanted \"Grant\".\nBut after arriving here, he noticed that a simple disguise was not enough to get past the custom officers.\nAfter some observation, he noticed that all of the soldiers held a strange cross in their hands. Every person who wanted to pass by would have the cross placed on their forehead, after a while, they would say \"no problem, not a mage\" as usual, and let the people pass through, continuing their check with the next person.\nBenjamin frowned deeply.\nWithout question, those crosses were the work of the Church. From the actions and words of the troops, these crosses were to determine whether one was a mage. How troublesome...\nHe hid aside while observing in the dark. The troops were professional, they did not leave out any part of the procedure. Every person who wanted to pass through would be checked about three to five minutes before being allowed to pass.\nJust by letting them check for three to five minutes, there was a chance Benjamin would be recognized, even more so with the cross.

He told the female boss that he was just taking a look around, and pretended to pick something, but in reality, he was using the water particle sensing technique to scout and feel the inner area of the Crusader Gateway.\nAfter just circling over the wall with the particles, he found a priest sitting in a room, reading.

        "output": "\"Well... you all can’t pass the gate, why still stay in this place?\" Thinking of this, he asked helplessly.\nEven though it felt weird, Benjamin ended up becoming part of an organization just like this.\nOf course, suddenly meeting twenty plus people, he could not remember all of them properly yet. The ones that left an impression were only a few: the female boss of the tailor shop, the blacksmith, a middle-aged man and a young girl. The remaining did not say much, he could not possibly remember them due to his poor ability to remember people’s faces.\nBut luckily, the System was here, it helped him save all that he was supposed to remember. At least, if he bumped into them onto the street, he would not end up in the awkward situation where one could not remember the other’s name.\nBefore the gathering ended, Benjamin made a new request.\nHe wanted to see that Mister Andrew.\nAccording to the female boss, this Mister Andrew who has done the research that can deceive the cross was introverted and did not like to leave home much. He was probably doing research at home right now.\nBut under the pressure from Benjamin, the middle-aged man promised that after dispersing he would bring Benjamin to Andrew’s house for a visit right away.\n-----After all, his inventions will determine whether or not they can leave the country. Benjamin wanted to see him.\nAndrew’s house was at the north part of town, it was a small hut that did not draw attention. According to the other people, besides being a mage, Andrew was also a clock smith. Maybe he had the knack for fixing those intricate things, thus he should have a natural talent for magical tools as well, and was able to make tools that can save a person by activating instantly. This was why he ended up devoting himself to researching the cross.\nHearing this, Benjamin was even more interested.\nThe Church has inhibited the creation of magical items all this time, so mages only end up with shoddy magical equipment. For the Church, a simple priest was already equipped with tons of crosses, but for the mages, other than mass-produced robes, other methods of making magical equipment has mostly been lost throughout the years.\nThus, it was not simple for a mage to create so many life-saving tools.\n\"Are you home? Andrew, it’s me, Augustine, please open the door.\"\nThe middle-aged Augustine led Benjamin to Andrew’s house door.

Say, what do you think is wrong with him these days? Why is he tormenting us several times a day, like an enemy is breathing down our necks?\"\n\"Who knows?

However, there was no doubt that the alerted priest whom Benjamin saw when he surveilled the insides of the gates using the Water Particle Detection was the bishop.\nBased on their conversation, the bishop was behaving oddly.\nAlthough Benjamin was slightly surprised when he heard that the Pope was going into isolation again, he did not understand the necessity for the bishop in Crusader Gateway to behave weirdly because of this. The bishop was so far away!\nUnless, there was a more sinister reason behind this ‘seclusion’. Benjamin shook his head when he came across this thought. The affairs in the kingdom was a mess, where the power players would intersect; they might be friendly today but stab each other tomorrow. It took him much effort to get out of that terrifying quicksand, and he had no intentions nor interest to go and find out what happened there.\nThe only thing that he would probably care about was what happened to the Lithurs after he left. Did the Church blame the thirty thousand ‘plague’ deaths on the Lithurs? What did Grant think about all the events that happened? What would Claude, Jeremy, and the madame be up to now?\nAlthough Benjamin did not live with them for a long period of time, they were still his family members after he came to this world. He did feel embarrassed when he used the word ‘family members’ though.\nBenjamin inhaled deeply, collected his wandering thoughts, and pulled himself together.

Based on the response of the water particles, Benjamin could see ten people checking the pedestrians by the gates, and two hundred people standing guard on the top of the gates; which corroborated with the information he got from the eavesdropping.\nThe structure of the Crusader Gateway slowly formed in his mind.\nThe gate looked more like a fortress, as it did not have much space to allow human movement.

        "output": "Benjamin thought about it for a moment. He shook his head. The idea he came up with was to disguise as a patrol guard to enter into the Crusader Gateways. However, the lady boss actually meant ‘stopping at the door at the pathway, placed the goods there and left’ when she said ‘sneak into the place’. There was no actual sneaking.\nThe more Benjamin thought about this, the more impossible this mission of stealing a cross seemed. Did this imply that he should just give up?\nHe further considered the situation. Suddenly, he switched the subject as he abruptly raised his head, \"When they ordered the cotton-padded clothes from town, do you know how much they actually ordered?\"\nThe lady boss looked surprised, as if she could not understand why Benjamin would want to know this.\nAfter frowning and thought about it for a moment, she finally answered, \"At that time…. It was approximately a thousand if you add all the other shops. They did buy another thousand from Varys, though.\"\nBenjamin nodded, deep in thoughts.\nAccording to the relatively excellent shift and holiday arrangements, the patrol guards were treated decently. If they wanted to order special clothes, they would only buy more of them instead of under-purchasing. Furthermore, when Benjamin observed the dormitory using the Water Particle Detection before this, he made a rough estimation that there would approximately be two thousand guards living in the gate.\nTwo thousand guards….\nBenjamin also noticed that their armour were not blessed, and were ordinary pieces of steel. Their training must be incompatible with the ones experienced by the Holy Knights or the Royal Knights, which meant that they would probably only have average combat prowess. The undefeatable aura around this place was solely due to the unbreakable door.\n\"What’s up? Why did you ask that?\" The lady boss was on a cliffhanger when Benjamin stopped talking for a moment.\n\"According to their order, we could conclude that there are almost two thousand people standing guard in the gates.\" Benjamin crossed his arms and stood leaning on the walls, \"I’m thinking about how strong these two thousand people would be in a battle.\"\nSurprise coloured the lady boss’ face as she quickly shook her head, \"You’re planning to barge your way through? No, that won’t work. There’s a bishop and 6 other priests in there; we couldn’t even handle that one bishop, there’s no point to even think about the other priests.\"\nBenjamin was quite shocked by that statement too. There were so many spellcasters guarding the Crusader Gateways?\nHe was already thinking about the specifics of a battle in his mind. After all, there were more than twenty mages in town, and soldiers without blessed equipments were unusually vulnerable when placed before a mage. If they could all sneak into the pathway of the gates and launch a surprise attack, they might break the defence line and escape directly out of the country. That no longer seemed to be feasible now.\nThe bunch from the Church was a force that they could never defeat."

Spells mastered are Fire Ball, Water Ball, Wind Blade, Earth Spike, Ice Breaking, and other beginner level attacks.\"\n\"Hannah, no specialty. Spells mastered are Face Washing, Cooling, and Elevated Temperature Baking.\"\n\"Frank, could not properly pronounce spells due to his heavy southern accent. The only spell he knew is the Water of Life.\"\n\"...\"\nBenjamin finally understood what the lady boss meant by ‘don’t have too high of an expectation’ when he finished listening to her introducing the twenty over mages. He held his forehead in his hands and was silent for a long period of time.\n‘Don’t have too high of an expectation’? This should be ‘don’t have any expectation’ instead!\nIt was evident from their appearance that their magical level would not be high. However, no matter how hard Benjamin looked, he would never imagined that their level would be this low!\nAside from the few, most of them knew less than three spells, and all of the spells were beginner level ones. You would be considered to be exceptional among them if you could release one or two beginner level spells.\nNo wonder…... No wonder they never thought of bulldozing their way through the door! Some of their combat prowess could not even match up with a normal patrol guard!\n\"Actually, we had no choice,\" The lady boss’ voice was tainted with helplessness, \"We do exchange spells and teach each other how to cast them. However, all of us became mages by chance. So, we didn’t know much, and we had no idea how to teach others either.\"\nBenjamin was silent for a long time before he could accept this fact. He shook his head and smiled, \"It’s fine, there will be a way.\"\nThe lady boss looked confused, \"What way?\"\nBenjamin did not answer that question directly. Instead, he decided to insert some suspense into his reply, \"You’ll see it tomorrow. Gather everyone together for a meeting tomorrow. I have an important announcement for you.\"\nActually, it was good to have weak abilities. In other words, a weak ability means that there was a greater room for improvement, and thus they would have a higher potential in magic! If they were strong initially, there was no need for Benjamin to be here.\n\"... Alright.\" The lady boss nodded despite still looking dumbfounded.\nIt was late already, and Benjamin left the hand-knitting shop to return to the tavern. Augustine’s place was connected to the back if the tavern. He arranged a guest room for Benjamin for his stay. Benjamin laid on the bed, but he did not fall asleep.\nNow, he was in the Space of his Consciousness with the System, figuring out the best cultivation method for normal mages."

There were more than twenty mages in the circle, and they could already form an encyclopedia of beginner level spells if all of them stumbled on some spells and exchanged them among themselves. Their problem was they had no idea how to train their spiritual energy and affinity to the elements. Thus, even if they knew the spells, they were unable to learn them.\nThat was probably the biggest disadvantage for those self-taught mage.\nBenjamin relied on the information in the \"Divine Arts 101\" about the Zone of Prayer and the Crest of Holy Light that he sneakily read it when he first knew magic. He found his own way of cultivation that way. Now, he was still thankful for \"Divine Arts 101\" because without it, he would never be able to summarize a ‘meditating’ method for these mages.\n\"Although I didn’t read through the details on those parts, but you did memorise them, right?\" He asked as he held the bead that was similar to a fish egg in his hand. He could not stop himself from pinching it as he spoke, \"There seemed to be quite a number of ways to train the spiritual energy and affinity to elements written in \"Divine Arts 101\".\n\"... Yes,\" The System drawled, losing hope in all of life.\nBenjamin was able to adopt the ways of training the Divine Arts into magical training owing to the discovery that the Divine Arts and magic were essentially the same. There was no doubt that the methods of cultivating the Divine Arts will be more advanced than what the mages have due to the long years of pillaging and development from the Church.\nThrough the recapitulation of the System and the meticulous selection by Benjamin, they found the meditation method that was most suitable for these people.\nThey would utilize the scattered magical elements in the surrounding, absorbing them into the brain with a special way before releasing them to train one’s spiritual energy and affinity to the related elements.\nThe other methods were eliminated due to inefficiency or the lack of external instruments as aide. The circumstances they were in were quite harsh; it would be impossible to obtain any useful aide.\nAfter the method was finalised, Benjamin got a notebook and wrote down the general steps and main points. He prepared to pass it to the others the next day.\nIn this process, he suddenly had the feeling that this was very similar to a lesson preparation.\nAt this point, Benjamin was no longer sure whether he should laugh or cry.\nHe spent one and a half hour to complete the preparation for the ‘first lesson’. After that, he mediated for a while before tucking himself under the blankets and was soon fast asleep.\nThe next day.\nHe woke up early in the morning and arrived at the hand-knitting shop. The lady boss used a magical instrument akin to a small bead to notify the other mages hidden in the town about the meeting.\nWhen Benjamin first saw this magical instrument, he could not help but recall the God’s Eye, the Church instrument. The lady boss later informed him that this was also produced by Andrew."

All of them were equipped with pens and papers, and the carpenter even prepared a large amount of stools for seats during the lesson.\nThey sat in rows, papers or notebooks on their knees, pens in their hands. Once Benjamin stepped out from the opening of the secret passage, they looked at him with faces so serious that Benjamin was slightly taken aback by the scene.\n\"We heard that you will teach us the way for us to become stronger today. Is that true?\" A young girl who sat in the front row stood up excitedly and asked the moment he came in.

Thus, he shook his head, still smiling and felt much less anxious for his first lesson.\n\"Alright, alright. It is not an easy task to be stronger than the Church.\" He waited for the commotion to settle before he continued, \"I had a brief understanding of your situation. Although you knew how to use magic, but if we are technical with the definitions, you are all apprentices and not mages.\"\nEveryone was paying full attention as they listened. Some even started to take notes even though Benjamin had no idea what was worth taking down from his speech. Maybe they were ignorant for too long, and even though they had strong desires for knowledge, no one was there to answer their questions.

Magic is a series of special effects such as attacks, heals, and defences that you achieved by summoning spells that could control the magical elements around you. It is definitely not what the Church called as ‘power of the devil’, or ‘the sign of the Fallen’. Thus, we do not need to feel uneasy about our identity as a mage.

It is natural.\"\n\"Next, let us learn more about the magical elements…...\"\nAll of the twenty plus people stared at Benjamin, their gaze bewildered. However, there was an underlying light beneath their eyes.\n\"Teacher, how do you come to know all of this knowledge?\"\n\"Teacher Benjamin, where does magical elements come from? Are they the formation blocks of the word? Or are they just a special presence that are dissociated from all matters in this world?\"\n\"Teacher, I didn’t manage to take down everything in my notes. Do you mind repeating what you said?\"\n\"Teacher Benjamin, do you know how to cast intermediate spells? Can you show us?\"\n\"Teacher….\"\nBenjamin was overwhelmed.

He has not even completed his own pursuit for knowledge, how could he handle all these questions?\n\"Um…. Guys, I’d like for you to stop addressing me as ‘Teacher’. Instead, just call me Benjamin,\" He said helplessly, \"I’m also a new mage, and am still slowly discovering the different facets of magic.

Everyone kept away their pens, papers and stools, and gratefully bowed to Benjamin before they dismissed themselves. Judging from their eager and passionate faces, they probably would start training right after they arrived in the comforts of their homes.\nBenjamin felt very flattered and touched by their actions. Setting apart the ripple effects could happen in the future due to his actions today, Benjamin felt that he might have already changed the course of their lives in the 30 minutes he spent talking to these 20+ mages. If Benjamin never existed, some of them would probably perish in the church’s hunt for mages; some of them would hide their identity forever and live their lives as commoners, taking up roles like an ordinary carpenter or a tavern owner. However, from today onwards, they would embark on the path of magic. They might die, or they might live an unforgettable and extraordinary life.\nNo one could see into the future. At least, the longing and anticipations that reflected in their eyes upon their departure actually existed here. Benjamin too left the ‘secret base’ that belonged solely to the mages. He returned to Augustine’s tavern.\nAugustine? Benjamin frowned as he tried to recall his whereabouts. He shook his head. \"No idea. Why, what happened?\"\nIf his guess was accurate, Augustine was probably hidden somewhere in town just like everyone else, obsessed with meditation. It would take some time for him to get out of the exercise.\n\"Oh, what should I do? There’s a conflict in the tavern, and it looked like a fight is going to start soon. We have no idea how to handle this!\"\nBenjamin scowled. Although he was reluctant to waste his time, but Augustine did take him in when he was looking for lodgings. Besides, Benjamin could not consider coldly driving the bartender off when the latter looked as helpless as a kitten up in a tree. Thus, he answered, \"I’ll go with you to see what’s going on.\"\nIf someone was indeed causing trouble, he could scare off the crowd easily; not with his magic, mind you, but with the gun that he still carried around. Thus, they started towards the tavern and arrived shortly after.\nThe atmosphere in the tavern was delicate indeed. Most of the people remained on their seats, very much interested in the events developing before them. At the area near the entrance, the patrons who sat around two tables were rattling with anger, and looked as if they were going to start a fight.\nAround a table was four strong-looking men who dressed like hunters and looked very fierce; while on the other table was two mysterious man clad in cloaks, swords pinned on their waists.\n\"Say that again, and I’ll turn your arms to paste,\" One man in cloak spat mysteriously.\n\"Come if you dare, you f*ggot son of a b*tch,\" barked a hunter from the other table, \"Go home and lick the soles of your blind queen; we do not welcome you here!\""

        "output": "Benjamin felt a headache growing after he accessed the situation. Nation conflicts are always a hot potato. This was probably not a rare occurrence in the Town of Crewe; it was a town by the borders after all, and Icor was just outside the Crusader Gateways. It was normal for quite a number of people to drop by from Icor, as although the countries’ relations was not exactly amicable, it was at least better than what it was back in the war days.\nBased on the hunters’ words, these two mysterious men were probably from the country ruled by that Queen - Icor.\nTo be frank, he usually would not be bothered to intervene in these issues. He did not possess the sense of belonging towards the Kingdom of Helius, nor did he have any impression towards the other countries. He was entirely neutral, which was why he was not inclined to involve himself in this.\nHowever, the hunter’s words were indeed too grating for the ears, and if there really was a fist fight here, the tables, chairs, plates, and cups will not survive unscathed. Benjamin will never allow that to happen.\nThus, Benjamin drew his pistol and released its safety before the two mysterious men drew their swords out of their sheaths. Then, he aimed at the filthy-mouth hunter and fired.\nBang!\nEveryone in the tavern, including the bartender behind Benjamin, was shocked at the sudden noise. As he was standing close to Benjamin, the thunderous crack of the gunshot made him weak on his knees as he nearly collapsed on the ground.\nMeanwhile, the bullet grazed the hunter who Benjamin aimed the shot at. It did not cause any injury, but it tore through his belt and split it clean in half. The belt broke apart immediately, and the hunter’s pants dropped to his ankles with a swish.\nThe hunter was stunned.\nAs the crowd recovered from the shock, they remained silence. Their eyes soon arrived at the more ‘interesting’ places after they stole a glance at Benjamin. The hunter who stood at the centre of attention failed to realise what has happened, but his instincts took over when his hands went straight down to cover his nether regions.\nIt was too late. Some of the people already caught a clear view, and their faces were one of surprise or disappointment. Some of them even barked an unintentional laugh.\n\"...\"\nThe situation was very awkward for a moment. Face bright red in embarrassment, the hunter glared at Benjamin who made the shot.\nThe atmosphere in the tavern became unusual once again. The crowd surrounding the scene looked interested again, but this time the identity of the two mysterious men was long forgotten; the main characters now are Benjamin and the table of hunters.\nThe hunter who was shot at finally realised the state he was in as he hurriedly pulled up his trousers.\n\"Oh, please, what are you still doing here?\" Benjamin sighed in annoyance, \"I have a gun, you don’t. You can’t fight me, so you can’t take your revenge. Since you can’t avenge your honour, stop wasting everybody’s time! Go back and fix your belt, alright?\""

        "output": "Benjamin felt that his words were very diplomatic and reasonable, but unfortunately the other party refused to see reason. \"I…. I will kill you!\" The hunter held his trousers and stomped, refusing to give in yet unable to rush over and attack Benjamin.\nThe situation became tense once again. The other hunters advised their companion, \"Ah, forget it. He has a gun.\"\nThe scene was at a bind for a moment before the hunters finally convinced their friend. He glared at both Benjamin and the mysterious men before he shuffled out of the tavern with his friends.\nAt last, the tavern was peaceful once again. The audience shook their heads in disappointment before they moved on with their lives. Benjamin also holstered his pistol and prepared to return to his quarters and continue meditating.\n\"Fellow brother,\" Benjamin halted his steps when he was called by a voice as he turned to take his leave, \"Thank you for your assistance.\"\nBenjamin turned to see the two mysterious man standing behind him in their cloaks. \"No problem, this is just an minor thing.\" Benjamin waved nonchalantly, \"I didn’t do this to help you. A friend of mine owned this tavern, I just wanted to prevent you from damaging his property in a fight.\"\nStrangely, the younger of the two men looked offended. \"That’s an unnecessary concern. If a fight did break out between us, the only thing that would be damaged is his arm,\" he said arrogantly as he touched the hilt of his sword that was pinned to his waist. At that, the elder one turned to scowl at him, as if he was criticising his immaturity. He did not deny that, though.\n….Oh?\nBenjamin’s interest was piqued as he remembered something. The two men gave off a specific vibe to Benjamin; they seemed less driven than war-hardened soldiers, but more prideful than the average bandits and thieves. This particular sense of casual sharpness triggered something in Benjamin’s memory. It was very similar with Chief Silverfox. They were travellers from foreign lands, too. It did not take Benjamin long to come to a conclusion when he noticed that their swords seemed to be enchanted.\n\"You’re mercenaries.\"\nTwo men shared a peculiar look the moment they heard Benjamin’s words. The elder turned to look at Benjamin as he spoke, \"My, my. This is certainly out of our expectations. There was still someone within the Kingdom of Helius who understood what this word meant! Please, do not spread the word, for we only came to locate a person. We have no malicious intent whatsoever.\"\nBenjamin shrugged in mild disbelief. He could not help but relate this two mercenaries from Icor with the foreign assassin that was sent in to assassinate the pope. Do they really have no other hidden agendas?\nAlthough Benjamin was very curious about their mission, but mercenaries were usually an honourable bunch that treated the rules of their profession with utmost respect. It was highly unlikely for Benjamin to get information from them. Thus, he did not take the risk of trouble and dropped the line of questioning altogether."

However, sometimes we do run a few missions in private.\"\nHe did not further elaborate, and it was evident that he was waiting for Benjamin to detail the specifics and rewards to his mission. The fact that he did not flat out refuse Benjamin’s offer was a good news in itself.\n\"Don’t worry, it’s an easy job.\" Benjamin held a large bag of gold coins and slightly shook it before them, \"I just need you to go to an isolated location in the Imperial Capital and dig out something that I want. Your mission will be completed once you passed the goods to me.\"\nFor safety reasons, Benjamin dealt with a number of his belongings before he left the kingdom. The crosses he salvaged from the priest, the Light Elemental Crystal, Annie’s Mirror of Mirage, a box full of blessed bullets…. Although Benjamin mentally prepared himself to the pain of giving up these things, but it would be great if there was a chance for him to regain them.\nThe crosses that could boost spiritual energy and its regeneration would be especially helpful to him now. Since he met these two mercenaries by coincidence, he might as well ask them to help him retrieve the goods. There was no need for him to be afraid that the mercenaries might leak the news that Benjamin is a mage - they had no idea that he is one! Besides, even if they found out that Benjamin was a mage, they would not expose it to the church either; after all, the church were suppressing mercenaries while they were hunting mages down. Enemies of the enemy are friends; it will be impossible for them to work with the church.\nThose were the reasons why Benjamin felt he could give this mission to these two men.\n\"The Imperial Capital… was indeed on the route of our journey,\" The elder mercenary said with reluctance, \"But we’re unsure of the duration of our stay in the Kingdom of Helius. We’re afraid to say that you might’ve already left when we return to the Town of Crewe.\"\n\"That’s not a problem. If I’ve left this town, I must be out of country already,\" Benjamin waved it off and answered, \"Tell me your names, and I will look for you in the Mercenary Association.\"\nThe mercenaries were hesitant at first, but they nodded after some contemplation. \"When you’re at the Mercenary Association, ask for Ciel and Louis. You’ll find us there.\""

The mister hired us to come here, but what could we find?\"\nThe elder mercenary looked gloomy as he said, \"It’s such a big mission that we must at least give it a go.

Finally, now he has the chance to catch up with his homework.\nOf course he did not spend all his time just meditating. He was not out of the woods yet as he was still within the borders of the Kingdom and could still be arrested by the Church. Therefore, he also spent time investigating further into the Crusader Gateway.\nThe tavern was the best place to obtain the latest information. He could just sit beside and eavesdrop or share a pint or two with other parties and he could easily find a lot of information he required.\nHe has met all kinds of people in the tavern.

You’re really a disappointment!\"\nBenjamin was surprised by the response. He was one of them. He actually thought that the Church had caught up to them.\nWell, this young man by the name of \"Frank\" did look familiar.\nAnd... sounded familiar too.\nIf it wasn’t the guy who had too strong of a southern accent and couldn’t really take on magic?\nFrank was embarrassed that he scratched his head, facing everyone’s cold shoulder, \"Please don’t be angry, I didn’t do it on purpose. I was late for a reason and I have also made an important discovery with this thing. Let me explain.\"\nBenjamin felt like laughing, hearing him talk.\nJust as lady boss introduced him, the young man spoke with a heavy accent that Benjamin could only understand a few phrases. He had to connect the dots in order to guess what message he was trying to convey.\nIt was no wonder he could only learn the Water of Life spell as he would have problem chanting with his heavy accent.\n\"What did you discover? That you could suffocate the Church with the thing you have in the bucket?\" The young lady sarcastically replied with dissatisfaction while holding her breath. Frank was used to sarcasm and ignored it. He giggled sheepishly.\nAlthough they still couldn’t bear with the smell but at least they did not turn their back on him.\n\"What’s in the bucket?\" Benjamin couldn’t help but ask.\nFrank removed the bucket lid and everyone curiously peered in. Inside, was some whitish yellowish fat gunk and surprising the scent came from there.\n\"It’s horse essence,\" revealed Frank. \"Griffins are fond of horse meat and they would not be able to resist horse essence that was extracted. We could distract the griffins with this and fly over the mountains with the Flight Spell.\"\nThey looked at one another.\n\"Erm... but has any of us have mastered the Flight Spell?\" The young lady thought about it and hesitantly stated, \"This is the hardest of all beginner level magic and calls for high affinity with the wind elements.\"\nFrank conversely was happy to answer, \"Nope, it’s not as you think it is. The Flight spell is not that hard and I’ve just learned it. As long as you put your mind to it, you can do it as well!\"\nThe rest had an odd expression in their faces.\nHe learned the Flight Spell... For real?\nIt wasn’t that they looked down on Frank but rather, they knew his southern accent was too thick for incantations. His journey to become a Mage has not been short and the only magic he mastered was the Water of Life. This alone was enough to indicate his talents on becoming a Mage.\nAnd now that they have just all learnt the way to meditate. It couldn’t be that Frank had mastered the Flight Spell which was a high difficulty level for beginner level magic in less than three days, could it?\nThey found it hard to believe and started to wonder whether this was a prank."

The entire chant wasn’t mispronounced.\nAccompanied by the spreading of light waves and the accumulation of the Wind Particles; suddenly, Frank’s sleeves flared up and he opened his arms as the tip of his feet left the ground. He was like a kite, slowly floating into the air.\n\"Oh my...\"\nThe crowd let out a shout. Nobody was bothered by the smell from the horse essence anymore.\nBenjamin was pleasantly surprised.\nHe could tell from Frank’s display of the spell that although his talent wasn’t there, his Spiritual Energy and affinity to the wind element wasn’t bad. It was just that he was bounded by the restriction of his accent that he couldn’t roll his tongue and pronounce the chants properly.\n— It was happened that the Flight Spell didn’t require the roll of the tongue.\nWhat dumb luck! Frank flew in the air for a while and slowly descended while the rest were in awe. Everyone was excited and gathered around Frank to ask how he’d did it.\nFrank in turn, gave them a surprising answer.\n\"I have always wanted to learn the Flight Spell and so when Sir Benjamin taught about the meditation nature, I’m thinking that if I work on my affinity to the wind element, would my affinity to element increase by folds?\" His eyes were beaming with excitement. \"So, I went to the Wind Fissure in the south to meditate.\"\nThe crowd were once again astonished.\n\"My, my... the Wind Fissure, are you mad?\"\nAlthough Benjamin wasn’t familiar with the topography of this area, he had been around town and staying in an inn. He has heard of the Wind Fissure. After all, it was a popular spot around here.\nThe Wind Fissure was situated south of the Town of Crewe. It was a rift beyond the mountain range. It was said to be a windy place all year long. Basically it was a level 8 degree typhoon which could literally blow someone away to the ends of the earth. Nobody was silly enough to head there and risk losing their life being blown away. To head to that area to meditate, that would take guts.\n\"During that time, I locked myself onto several kilograms of metal chains to prevent myself being blown away. I was lifted half way into the air by the wind yet held back by the chain while meditating.\" Frank showed deep red markings on his wrists and continued, \"The air was filled with nothing but Wind Particles. I could only draw the Wind Particles to polish my Spiritual Energy and Affinity to Elements. Although there is no improvement towards other elements, my affinity to the wind element has increased tremendously!\" ... Oh?\nListening to all this, the crowd did not harbour any shocked or inapprehensive expression. On a contrary, they were all silent and lowered their heads as they were deep in thought.\nFrank’s words had enlightened them to contemplate."

        "output": "Benjamin wasn’t that much enlightened as the way he practised was different from the rest and so if he were to dive deep into the sea of thought, the strengthening of his runes would not improve much.\nHowever, there was no denying that he was pleasantly surprised by Frank’s words.\nHe didn’t think that by teaching them ways to mediate, they were able to improvise their meditation based on their own needs.\nAlthough this may just be scratching the surface of ‘improvement’ — by changing the environment of meditation to change the outcome. As long as one spent some time on it, it was easy to figure out. Benjamin was still impressed with the logical thinking that came with it.\nAs long as they dared to change, innovate and try.\nCome to think of it, this could be the benefit of mages without formal teachings. Nobody taught them about fearing the magical gods or Cain kinda bullcrap. Under Benjamin’s \"atheist\" influence, the group was fearless against all odds.\nOne has to have this attitude to be a Mage!\nWhat’s the point of being a Mage if it meant praying and worshipping the gods and blindly following ancient teachings?\nThe group quickly broke from their thoughts and engaged in another heated discussion.\nFrank’s way of meditation had greatly inspired them. Perhaps they did not need to resort to extreme measures like chaining themselves against the typhoon to meditate. They could use a more approachable method, such as soaking in water to learn water spells, meditate near a stove to learn fire spells, or burying oneself in the sand to learn earth spells.\nAs long as one dared to imagine, there were a lot of ways.\nBenjamin didn’t think that they managed to come up with a \"dual practice\" method.\nLet’s say if a person would like to strengthen their affinity to the water element, then another person would be throwing Water Balls at him. The Water Balls were different from the water in real life, as they can quickly disintegrate the Water Particles and absorbed by the person in meditation. Two people would work together, one who would assemble the particles and the other would utilise them. The efficiency of the practice would be a lot faster than simply meditating in the bath. Benjamin was shocked with their conclusions.\nWho would have thought that in a world where it has yet to be industrialised, the concept of work sharing seemed to be distant. However, the people of this era managed to build this concept into the practice of magic. Mmm... Interesting.\nBenjamin was filled with anticipation.\nTo think he was worried about their future three days ago. They managed to find their own path in just a mere three days.\nSo... what’s next?"

It could be perhaps their stay at the Town of Crewe was too long; nobody except him was completely focused on the plan to escape the kingdom. They seemed more intent to continue training in the town. However, Benjamin was clear that the kingdom was under the play of the Church. A temporary calm didn’t mean that the mages could hide away in a tiny town such as this.\nThe Church was either killing mages or on the way to kill mages. Unless they escape the kingdom, one day it would be their heads on the chopping board.\nThat was why Benjamin didn’t charge head first into training like the rest.\nHe had to think about crossing the gateway.\nFrank’s plan had provided Benjamin with new string of ideas — If they couldn’t penetrate the Crusader Gateway, they could still think of ways of getting pass the griffins on the mountains. Although griffins were large in quantity and had incredibly strong attacks, their intelligence did not surpass that of humans. Using the horse essence to lure them away was smart but not a feasible solution - all he needed was a better plan.\nOver the next few days, he persisted on his meditation homework while collecting all sorts of data about the griffins. There wasn’t a library in the town, but he was able to collect unverified data through conversations in the inn. Data such as griffins liking shinny items, their favourite prey being horses, how they have excellent vision, hearing and a sense of smell...\nHe was afraid that if it kept up, the list would be about dragons instead of the griffins.\nIn the meantime, he had even looked for the merchant, Varys. This merchant cum Mage was also heels deep into training and after the class with Benjamin, also held Benjamin high in his heart. Therefore, when Varys found out that Benjamin was looking for him, he was excited to welcome him.\n\"Teac-…..

He then turned and continued, \"I want to know if they have purchased any new supplies.\"\nVarys lifted his thin eye brow in surprise.

Once he was moved to the kitchen or pantry area, he would sneak out of\nthe sack. It was a good idea but the issue was that the people tend to check the food when received. So how he could hide in the sack without being noticed was the question they had to solve.\nThe hardest question would still be whether he could get pass the food supply checking process.\nBenjamin and Varys spent a lot time debating on this matter.\ninspect and check its quality.\" Varys said, \"However, if they think we were cutting corners, they would inspect in detail during weighting. If there was a bag whose weight was out of the ordinary,\nthey will open it up to investigate.\" A person’s body was a lot lighter than wheat. If a person were to smuggle into the sack of wheat, they would definitely be found out once if it was weighed."

The overall ability of the Mage guild was also on the rise. Benjamin was also returning to his original abilities before the rift, through meditation.\nMost importantly, the Water Runes that had exploded had been re-condensed by Benjamin four days ago.\nFinally... He could use the Water Ball spell.\ncringingly bounced forward. Benjamin almost laughed out loud.\nOh, System.\nBenjamin was quite satisfied with the state things were now.\nconquer the world or something. He had previously tried to, but couldn’t, bring the little thing out of the Space of Consciousness.\n\"Do you really think this will work? What if you miscalculated?\" Suddenly, the System voiced out in Benjamin’s Space of Consciousness.\n\"I did not miscalculate.\" Benjamin answered expressionlessly. He thought that once Augustine bore news to him, Varys would have prepared everything and that\nhe would be sneaking into a sack full of wheat, transported to the Crusader Gateway, and be stealing the cross that very night.\nHe didn’t think that Augustine would inform him of something very different. He came to Benjamin’s rented room during the afternoon. Benjamin returned to reality from his meditation and was told about a Mage from the little guild — news on Andrew, the stammerer who\nhas a talent on magical equipment. \"Andrew? There’s new development?\" Upon hearing his name, Benjamin was caught off guard. He quickly came back to his senses and followed up. His plan to steal the cross was to help Andrew in\nresearching new ways to deflect the cross. He hadn't even made a move yet and Andrew came through on his end. Benjamin wouldn’t have to put himself in danger.\nHe was filled with anticipation when he went up to see Andrew.\nHowever, his anticipation was not met by reality. There was no new development in Andrew’s research. However, he told Benjamin a valuable bit of information.\nstumped. Take the crosses used at the gateway to check for mages as an example, the cross definitely did not come from the gates but should have been pre-made elsewhere and sent over.\nHe quickly forced these questions to the back of his head but surprisingly Andrew knew the answers anyway.\n\"Where is this army?\" He asked, \"They haven’t reached the Town of Crewe, have they? Which route did they take, does your uncle know?\"\nBenjamin. Taking care of them, being in the middle of nowhere, without the protection of the gateway and fortress would be easy for Benjamin who has recovered all his abilities.\nCome to think of it, he could snatch the crosses right from the palm of their hands instead of risking himself by being stuffed in a wheat sack and smuggled into the gates.\nBenjamin didn’t feel rushed, on the contrary, the timing was just right."
